1|Five days after AR-15 has gone missing.
2|...That is our latest information on AR-15, Mr. Kryuger. The Commander and AR Team are still actively searching for her.+In addition, I have approved the [Emergency Command Authority] for Squad 404.
3|...You should've only given them the authority as a last resort.
4|The threat 404 faced was far more serious than expected.+Perhaps that jammer really is related to Parapluie.
5|Hm...+Where are they now?
6|They are currently operating in Area S06.+We'll have to wait for them to come back alive for further information.
7|Meanwhile at the territory of dispute in Area S06.
8|Hey, wake up.+416, wake up~!+Heyyyy~~!
9|Ugh...+...Shut up.
10|Hey! You doing okay, 416?
11|If you want me to say "I'm doing great" then help me move this rock...
12|Alright. We have three minutes until the S.F. clean-up teams arrive, so I'll help you out.
13|(Moving rock) Do you hear that gunfire in the distance? I'm out of here if I see trouble.
14|I'll twist your head off if you dare turn your back on me.
15|Don't be so vicious. It's not my fault that the Sangvis are prepared.
16|It's only a communications jammer. Do they really need to be defending it this desperately?
17|We underestimated the situation. There's a reason why Helian gave us such a high offer.
18|Yeah, and this place is full of radar stations. We'll get spotted as soon as we poke our heads out.
19|Then let's quickly capture those radar stations since we're engaging in night battle, otherwise we won't even have vision of the area.
20|I don't think we can do it with just the two of us. The Sangvis have armored units this time.
21|Is that so...+No wonder our bullets are useless. Can we somehow get armor piercing ammo?
22|45 is trying to come up with a solution, but I don't know if she has figured anything out yet...
23|Quit pulling my leg, 9. 45's already got it figured out, hasn't she?
24|(Stop) Eh? How do you know...?
25|Because it's been three minutes and you still haven't ran yet.
26|Ha...♪+This is the last of them. Count yourself lucky.
27|I'll contact 45 now. You find a spot to set up an ambush.+But seriously though, the Sangvis are gonna be here very soon. You sure you don't wanna pray first?
28|The Sangvis are the ones who will be praying if everything goes well with 45's plan.
29|Calling UMP9, is 416 dead yet?
30|Sorry to disappoint. Tell me you're going to withdraw us now.
31|Don't be in such a rush to leave, 416. I don't plan on losing.+I'll break you guys out. 9 will then group up with me for a new objective.+Gr G11 is gathering intel in enemy territory, so you'll need to meet up with her and act as her bodyguard, 416. We'll pick you two up after.
32|(Sigh) Don't be in such a rush to give us orders when we're not even prepared to go against armored enemies.
33|(Quietly) And we have to find the jammer in the dark as well...
34|Don't worry, Helian just granted me the [Emergency Command Authority].+Griffin has also given us the authority to use equipment, so you don't need to worry about your problem anymore.
35|That's great! With Griffin's resources, our squad and AP ammo problems are now solved!
36|What about our limited vision? We can't even see the enemies right now.
37|We can rely on a HG T-Doll to provide our squad with enhanced vision in the dark.+Moreover, I will have our squad seize control of the radar stations to gain even more vision.
38|AP ammo, HG T-Doll, and radar stations! Victory is ours as long as we have all three!
39|We'll need to be extra careful as we have limited vision.+Move out when you are ready and try not to draw enemy attention.
40|...Infiltration success. UMP9 and 416 have split off to their target locations.
41|This is 416. I've reached my destination. Currently seaching for Gr G11.
42|Huh? According to the radar, shouldn't Gr G11 be right beside you?
43|It's all trees here. I don't know where she is hiding...+...Oh, nevermind.+Wake up, Gr G11.
44|No... I don't wanna...
45|Wake up, we don't have time.
46|Uuuu... Don't kick...
47|Ah, 416... What are you doing here?
48|Are you still dreaming?+You said you needed protection, didn't you?
49|Oh... 45 said you might've kicked the bucket.+That's why I was gonna nap 'til after midnight and then sneak out.
50|Sorry to bother you while you were napping, Gr G11 ♪. 416 insisted that she came.
51|...You guys.
52|Don't get violent, 416... Aren't you here to protect me?
53|(Deep breath) ...This area is full of enemies. Let's find a place to hide first.
54|Uuuu... Hold on.+I fell asleep earlier... Let me check the sound recording first.
55|......+You got one minute, otherwise I'll bring you back in six different pieces.
56|Recording playback starts...
57|...Good evening.+Welcome to Area S06, my dear friends from Griffin.
58|Hey, what's going on!
59|I-I don't know. I was very careful.
60|How are you finding this night assault? Are you satisfied?
61|This voice... Is this their Ringleader?
62|...The night is still young...+But unfortunately for you guys, it will be over very soon...
63|Shit!+Gr G11! Get down!!
64|Boom!!!
65|Meanwhile at Area S06 Sangvis command center.
66|Ouroboros, a sound triggered bomb has went off in point F3 of Area S06.+Based on the captured images, the enemies are confirmed to be Squad 404, but we cannot confirm if they have been wiped out.
67|Then get closer and send out a team to ensure that they've been eliminated.
68|Are you sure? Agent has said that we should avoid conflict with Griffin as much as possible.
69|Hunter, it is exactly because you are too inflexible and too reliant on your experience that you got crushed by AR-15.+Listen, my goal is their leader, not these few small fries.+The point is to lure out their boss.
70|404 and AR Team are different, though. How do you know their boss won't write them off as a loss?
71|Exactly because they are 404.+Humans will betray friends in times of hardship, but they will not abandon pawns while they're still valuable.
72|Ouroboros...+Then, what about me? Why not pick a stronger Doll to work for you? Why did you rescue me?
73|Because you have experienced failure. You will be more cruel in vengeance, and you will be more cautious after suffering humiliation.+It is evident that you are the perfect choice against Griffin.+Now, my question to you is... Will you disappoint me?
74|......+No, I will not betray your expectations, Ouroboros.
75|I'll leave for the outpost now...
76|Go, Hunter. Protect the Area S06 outpost and eliminate all the Griffins that show up!
77|Ten minutes later at the location of 416 and Gr G11.
78|Uuu... Hurry up, 416! The Sangvis are gonna catch us!
79|Shut up! Why don't you try to carry me while you're running instead?+...Shit, there's nowhere to go up ahead. 45, where's our extraction?
80|Very close by. We're right under you!
81|Are you serious? We're on a cliff!
82|I know. Just keep running and jump!
83|...So you're finally disposing of us, 45?
84|Not yet, 416, trust me.
85|Listen to her and jump! I know what's down there!
86|(Sigh) I'll trust you, Gr G11.+Since you're a death-fearing coward...
87|Get ready! One, two...
88|Three!+......
89|An hour later in the airspace above the territory of dispute in Area S06.
90|Hey Gr G11! Turn off your sleep mode and get ready for battle!
91|Uuu... I can't... I need some more time to heal...+416 fell on me and broke my waist earlier in that explosion.
92|Sorry, I'll leave you to explode into a million pieces next time.
93|I don't care... I'll fall apart if I don't lie down. I wanna go home...
94|Get up, we're not gonna get paid if we leave now! (Pinch)
95|Uuuuuuuu...
96|Quit teasing her, 9, and look out for their anti-air defense.
97|We'll be fine. This aircraft has active camouflage. We won't get spotted unless Dreamer is here.
98|Speaking of this aircraft... Where did you guys find this?
99|A Griffin reconnaissance team left it here. Gr G11 found it and reported it to 45.
100|(Sigh) So you guys lied to me and made me go out of my way for nothing...
101|Fool thyself, fool thy enemy. Isn't that right, Gr G11, you little trickster? (Pinch)
102|Uuuuuuuu...
103|Alright, quit playing around. Helian is calling us, pay attention.
104|Squad 404, the report from our scout in Area S06 has just arrived. The Sangvis has deployed radars that cover the airspace in your path.
106|We're still working on the location of the jammer. Do you plan to standby?
107|Well...+We are currently near the back of the Area S06 outpost. If we land now, we'll be in a good position for a sneak attack.
108|You plan on capturing the Ringleader in the outpost to directly get the location of the jammer?
109|Yes. We don't have a lot of time, so it's better for us to take the initiative.
110|Very well. According to our report, the Ringleader stationed at the outpost is Hunter.+She has gone through an "Elite" modification. Be careful.
111|Understood. Are we clear on the objective, everyone?
112|Find Hunter and defeat her.
113|It'll be no big deal if even AR Team has defeated her before.
114|Same as always, huh? Let's go.
115|...The battle is coming to an end.
116|I'm...at my limit...+Ouroboros...where are the reinforcements that you had promised earlier? The outpost is about to be overtaken!
117|Even you should be aware that their target is you, right, Hunter?+It goes without saying that leaving you there is the easiest way to protect the jammer.
118|Ouroboros...+You... You knew this was going to happen, and you intended abandon me right from the beginning, didn't you?
119|Hunter, do you know how I was created?+Pitted against thousands of AIs in thousands of chess deathmatches, I was the only one to survive.+From what I can see, your value as a pawn has been exhausted.
120|War is not chess! You're neglecting too many factors, Ouroboros! You will soon regret this!
121|I take everything into consideration to reach my most desired results.+....It is unfortunate for you that this is the result.
122|2612-1192a2516-31913, initiate format command.
123|Restarting host. Neural cloud backup in progress. Unable to connect to network. Unable to complete neural cloud backup. Switching to current access. Format complete.
124|Go to sleep, Hunter. I have no use for you anymore.
125|Ten minutes later. Squad 404 arrives at Hunter's location and begins to investigate the situation.
126|Unable to wake up Hunter. No response at all.
127|It's all your fault, Gr G11. You should've shot her legs.
128|Yeah, blame me all you want. You weren't the one that had to make the shot...
129|It's not Gr G11's fault. Someone even higher up than Hunter must've shut her down.
130|Damn it! We went through so much trouble to defeat Hunter and we ended up with nothing!
131|So we came for nothing. Wanna go home?
132|Let's leave now...+Hear that? New enemy forces are closing in fast.
133|Perhaps...they're not after us?
134|Huh? What do you mean?
135|I'll be right back. 416, take everyone to the other side of the outpost and try to avoid the enemy.+Perhaps...there is still an opportunity.
136|...Squad 404 engages Hunter at the Area S06 outpost.
137|So you 404 rats have finally shown up!+Don't think I'm unprepared for your underhanded methods! Let me see you vermin run for your lives and die as I cut you down one by one!
138|...At Squad 404's position.
139|Gr G11, did you even hit your shots?
140|I hit Hunter four times...but I think our intel is off, because she's still alive!
141|This "Elite" modification is incredible... What else do they have up their sleeves?
142|Enemies coming in from the right. We'll be surrounded soon!
143|Abandon objective. Cover our retreat with suppressive fire.
144|Suppressive fire, Gr G11!
145|D-doing it!
146|Deploying smoke grenade!
147|Everyone! Run now!
148|Tch...
149|Why aren't you after them, Hunter?
150|That silver-haired brat destroyed my Exo equipment. I can't chase after them unless it's repaired first.
151|So you're giving up just like that? I thought you'd be more persistent in chasing after your prey.
152|They'll be back for the location of the jammer.+I can delay their guerrilla tactics as long as your reinforcements arrive on time.
153|...Very well. Stay there and guard the outpost before the reinforcements arrive.
154|I will...+A true hunter knows how to stay silent.
155|Some time later in a safe sector of Area S06.
156|45 still isn't back yet?
157|Have some patience. Although I don't know what she's doing.
158|Om nom nom nom... Cotton... Candy... Princess...
159|Gr G11 is sleeping like we're at home or something. If 45 doesn't return soon...
160|Sorry to make you wait, ladies.+I'm back, and I've brought a friend from Griffin with me.
161|H-hello...everyone, I'm SPP-1...
162|...
163|...... (Scared)
164|Since when did you become kindhearted enough to look after lost children, 45?
165|Ever since when we needed her. Isn't that right, SPP-1?
166|Yes, I'm...the scout assigned to Area S06...
167|Haha, so you were the one that provided us with the information on the stealth aircraft and the S.F. Ringleader earlier?
168|Yes... I originally had an elite T-Doll escorting me, but she...
169|Died or went missing, right? Another sob story.+And what is your purpose here? Why did 45 bring you back with her?
170|Don't be mean, 416. We're lucky that she's here to help.
171|(Sigh) I'm only looking out for her. If you consider what 45 put us through earlier...
172|Nevermind that. SPP-1 has important information for us, doesn't she?
173|Y-yes... Helian contacted me earlier and said you guys are looking for the coordinates of the jammer?
174|You...already know where it is?
175|Ha! We haven't been this lucky in a long time! I thought we were cursed for life!
176|Let me hug you, Goddess of Luck!
177|No no, I'm the lucky one here.+I was on the run after being separated from my escort.+I would've been captured by the enemy if you guys did not defeat Hunter back there.
178|I'll give you guys the coordinates right now. Please take note of the Ringleader that is guarding the jammer.
179|...Executioner? Another Sangvis that AR Team had already dealt with before.
180|An enemy that M4A1 had already fought before...?
181|She must've gone through the same modification as Hunter! We'll need to bring more ammo...
182|Let's move out if we're all ready. Our objective is to seize the jammer.
183|Objective accomplished. I've destroyed all four of Executioner's limbs.
184|Seems like you've recovered quite well, Gr G11.
185|I'm feeling much safer with you being my meat shield.
186|Be grateful. You would never have received this sort of generosity in the past.
187|Hey, we're all family now, don't sweat the formalities.
188|I would love to believe you if you weren't produced unconventionally.
189|Haha, what's the difference? Aren't we living a pretty good life?
190|It's not good at all. I wanna go home...
191|Just accept reality. You lost your home a long time ago...
192|You guys, quit chatting and help me inspect Executioner.
193|Hehe, with communications blocked by the jammer, we can ask questions "nicely".
194|(Kicks) Hey, any last words? We can pass a message to your boss for you once we move the jammer out of here.
195|I'm afraid you won't be passing out any messages...
196|Because this whole place is rigged with explosives!
197|...?! Explosives?
198|There's no escape for you! With the press of a button, Squad 404, the jammer, and everything else will be turned to dust.
199|Wait a minute! Aren't you guys supposed to be protecting the jammer?!
200|That's why Ouroboros is someone that does whatever she wants...
201|This was her plan all along. Hunter bought us time while explosives were placed all around the jammer.+It doesn't matter what happens along the way, because as long as you reach this point, the ending for you will be all the same...
202|Ouroboros... Why would you go along with a suicidal plan like this?
203|Squad 404, do the Griffin squads in your hands have a choice when it comes to orders?
204|When you send them to their death to accomplish a goal, will you consider their feelings?
205|...
206|45...
207|So...we can't go home anymore?
208|(Bitter laugh) Get on your knees and apologize, 45. I've been waiting for this for far too long.
209|What awaits Dolls like us is neither heaven nor hell.+Squad 404...+You will disappear from this world along with me...
210|...At Area S06 Sangvis command center.
211|Agent...+I regret to inform you that our jammer has been destroyed in the explosion just now.+Executioner placed the explosives without my authorization and she seems to have destroyed herself along with Squad 404 in the explosion.
212|That jammer was instrumental in carrying out Parapluie. To exchange it for only four measly lives of ragtag T-Dolls...
213|I apologize for ignoring the instabilities in the AIs of Hunter and Executioner and not being able to detect their dereliction of duty in a timely matter.+I have already dispatched teams toward the site of the explosion to confirm their deaths.
214|What is even there to confirm, Ouroboros?+Withdraw immediately. I want a detailed report, do you understand?
215|Yes... Your wish is my command, Agent.
216|To all Sangvis units in Area S06...+...Expand your search area for 404 and pick up the pace.+Immediately converge on and destroy any Griffin T-Dolls found!+...Do not rely on the mech units, you must verify their deaths with your own eyes.+Nobody is leaving until Squad 404's corpses have been confirmed!
217|Squad 404 is engaging in heavy firefight with Executioner near the location of the jammer.
218|You're here...the rumored Squad 404, you're finally here!+I want you to tremble and fear before I cut you apart!+I will deal unto your corpses the shame and humiliation that I received from M4A1!
219|That name again!+Gr G11, can you shut her mouth up for good?!
220|Uuu...sca-scared...+I wanna...I wanna go home...
221|Gr G11 is scared witless! 416, bring her farther away!
222|I can't, we'll be out of range.+If we keep this up, Gr G11's neural cloud will...
223|Let's withdraw for now. We'll deal with her like we did with Hunter, by exhausting her of her supplies!
224|Roger! Gr G11, we're throwing our smoke grenades!
225|Uuu... Thr-thr-throw...+Is it time to throw out the trash, master...?
226|Throw her grenade for her, hurry!
227|Hmph, you bunch of cowards, I already know what you plan to do.+Struggle all you want, but you'll soon realize that...+Ouroboros has already planned everything out...including your death.
228|Some time later, near the Sangvis Ferri jammer in Area S06.
229|Found you, 404.
230|Uwaa!
231|Stop hiding. Your legs...have already given up on you, haven't they?
232|Y-y-y-you're Ouroboros?!+H-h-h-h-h-how did you find me?!
233|Your ability to hide is no longer effective. Griffin's identification signals are all over the map now.
234|How could this be...? It was hard enough for us to escape back there, and now...
235|Don't get me wrong, I'm actually very grateful that you survived the explosion...+What a pity it would be if I couldn't turn you into delectable corpses with my own hands!
236|...Damn it! This is just a dummy!+Squad 404...where are you?!!+I will find you, whether you're still alive or a corpse!+You slum rats! You radioactive worms!+I will deliver you death by a thousand cuts with my nails! I will simulate a thousand different vicious executions in your neural clouds!!
237|Meanwhile at an area farther away from Area S06.
238|Phew...+That banshee scares me with her shrieks even from several kilometers away.
239|Thank goodness she went crazy, otherwise she would've seen through your terrible acting.
240|I thought this was supposed to be a covert operation... Do we really have to fight her?
241|With enemy squads everywhere, I don't think we can make a sneaky getaway...
242|You two are a bunch of scaredy-cats. Take a leaf out of my book and just have faith in 45.
243|You can't rely on me all the time. Trusting each other is our only hope.
244|Quit saying things that you don't even believe in yourself. Make good use of us so we can all escape.
245|Ouroboros is dying to chomp us down, so we cannot let her know that we're still alive.+We must first figure out where her command center is before I come up with the next step of the plan.+This will be our final objective of the entire mission so take it seriously.
246|Is that your way of encouraging us, 45?
247|No, it's my way of threatening you.+Get a move on if you want to live ♪
248|At Area S06 Sangvis command center.
249|...The main force in Area S06 has been defeated and the command center is on the verge of collapse.+We have lost against Griffin and Squad 404.+Although, I'm not surprised at this result at all...
250|Ouroboros, this is your first and will be your last mission. You have failed completely.
251|...I'm very sorry for not being able to protect the jammer.
252|It's not a big deal. Truth to be told, the jammer has already been moved back to HQ.
253|What?!+The jammer...was clearly destroyed in that explosion!
254|Many things cannot be anticipated when you are so careless.+But you have to understand, we are different from Griffin. Second chances don't come that easily.
255|You're getting rid of me, aren't you...?
256|I simply...understand your thought process quite well.+Do you have any last words?
257|Curse you...+Curse you! Sangvis, Griffin, Squad 404!+I have never been wronged like this in my entire life!+Gr G11, UMP9, 416, UMP45!+You rats that only know how to scurry in the shadows!+I will not lose like this! I will escape and have my revenge!
258|Sorry, that's not going to happen.
259|Nice to meet you. I'm UMP45 from Squad 404.
260|......+So you're the rumored UMP45...+For someone like you that has conducted so many successful covert operations, you must be a cold-blooded monster.
261|No one willingly becomes a monster.+It is precisely because I'm not that cool that I've been able to keep myself alive.
262|I still don't understand...how you escaped the explosion unscathed.
263|I took a little advantage of...Dolls' emotions.
264|What awaits Dolls like us is neither heaven nor hell.+Squad 404...you will disappear from this world along with me...
265|Wait! Maybe we can talk?+What if I told you we have Hunter in our hands?
266|...What?!
267|Ouroboros cut off Hunter's consciousness, but she is still alive and we are taking good care of her.
268|What...does that have to do with me?
269|Let's be honest, you want to save Hunter, don't you?+Furthermore, you are completely capable of doing so with your authority.
270|You want me to betray my mission?
271|At least you have the choice, right?
272|......+It seems that you understand us quite well.
273|♪ So...do we have a deal?
274|Hand over Hunter and get lost within two minutes. Don't get in my way of retrieving the jammer.
275|Hahaha, what a joke!+Why would Executioner betray me for a worthless Doll?!
276|Executioner didn't betray you. She received a higher priority directive.
277|Sangvis Dolls have never been emotionless killing machines.+Especially the innovative designs like Hunter and Executioner. Being able to help each other means they can stay alive longer on the battlefield.+That's why she saved Hunter instead.
278|How do you know all this? You even know more about the priority of Sangvis authority than I do...
279|I don't, actually. I simply gambled on it.+Perhaps...this is Agent's insurance for keeping you in check.
280|Do you feel defeated? We both abandoned our original missions, yet we ended up with completely opposite results.
281|I have always wanted to prove myself, but in the end, I ended up being used by you.+You...are a stain on me, 404...
282|Sorry.+We are a stain on everyone.
283|But too bad those that want to erase us and not rely on us...+...End up being erased themselves.
284|Hey, 45, done yet?
285|It's finished. Where are the others?
286|OTs-14 is already on her way back to HQ. I'll go retrieve Gr G11 now.
287|You're taking too long, 416... Did you forget about me...?
288|Thank you for reminding me. I actually did forget.+Why don't you take a nap and come back by yourself later?
289|Uwaa... Come get me... It's too cold here...
290|The mission is finally complete, but it's a bit of a shame that we weren't able to capture the jammer.
291|416... Are you listening? Come get me...
292|With Ouroboros's corpse and all the gather intel we've gathered throughout the entire mission, I think it'll be enough to satisfy Helian.
293|It's definitely enough. Let's get out of here before the Commander shows up~
294|Good job everyone. Let's go home.
295|Umm...guys? Are you still there?+Don't leave me here... I wanna go home...
296|Ten minutes after the conclusion of Griffin's Operation Cube.+In Area S06 Sangvis command center...
297|Hello, anyone still here?+Heyyyy~!+Ah...everyone's gone...+Agent, they're all gone. You sure your eyes weren't playing tricks on you?
298|I can confirm in the video recording that Squad 404 came into contact with the jammer.+The "program" has indeed infected that Doll.+Parapluie can finally be moved on to the next phase.
299|So the entire point of this operation was to infect a T-Doll with the "program".+Having gone to such great lengths to hide it, I doubt anyone will notice...+I'm truly no match for you, Agent.
300|Do what you're supposed to do, unless you want to end up like Ouroboros.
301|Hehe, it was a pity that this happened with Ouroboros.+I thought she was quite promising. I didn't expect her to cause such a big racket.
302|...The incompetent will always be destroyed by their own ignorance.+There is no need to be responsible for their failure if they cannot even reflect on this point.+The night is coming to an end. Let it all vanish to darkness.
303|A Griffin squad raids the Sangvis command center and is fighting head-to-head with Ouroboros.
304|Damn it, an attack by Griffin!+They must be under the command of Squad 404... So, they're alive after all!
305|Guess again, Ouroboros.
306|That undignified look of distress on your face... It doesn't suit you.
307|OTs-14, you're still alive?
308|This is how life is, Ouroboros, not everything will go your way.
309|......+You're right. Savoring your deaths without having to do any work myself isn't very likely to happen...
310|Your mission has already failed in that explosion. Do you still intend to fight to the death?
311|For my self-worth and dignity... Slaves like you will not understand...
312|I can destroy you and every T-Doll under Griffin's command!+Including AR Team, Squad 404, and elites like you.+I will prove to the Mastermind that I am infinitely more valuable than any jammer could ever be!
313|So it was OTs-14 that was with SPP-1! Helian really helped us out this time!
314|So, there's our victory condition. What's the plan, 45?
315|We'll move out while she's dealing with Ouroboros's main forces.+UMP9, continue to use your dummies as bait to delay the enemies that are after us.
316|Leave it to me. I'll initiate all the simulated signals!
317|416, carry Gr G11 to an elevated point at target area R13 to cover our withdrawal.
318|Roger... 416, be gentle, I don't want to wake up on the way there.
319|No problem, I'll knock you out before I drag you over there.
320|After setting up Gr G11, 416 will head over to assist OTs-14. She'll be leaving with us.+We will wear out Ouroboros until we can destroy its command center.+Keep your comms open, ladies, and let's move out.
412|...
440|Ten minutes later.
462|Click.
465|Ugh...
627|...!
716|...+......
724|...!
863|What...did you say?
892|...BOOM!
922|Yeah...
1057|...+......
1146|I...
1168|What is it?
1520|...?
1899|...BOOM!!
2299|What?
2334|Ugh...
2489|...?!
2682|A moment, please.
3080|...Bang!
3238|...!!
3312|...!!
3835|...Indeed.
3909|A month ago, in a territory of dispute in Area S09...
3910|Current time is 0559, the sky is clear.
3911|Let's get cracking, M4.
3912|Persica, this is the AR Team.+We have already reached coordinates V6J69-HJYRV, Rendezvous Point A in Sangvis territory. There is no wind, and the view is clear.+Repeating mission objective
3913|Then...where should we start?
3914|We'll take over a command post first and hack into the Sangvis database for the information.
3915|Our target is the command post over there. AR Team, operation commence.
3916|Command post successfully taken over. Hacking into the database.
3917|...Have you guys thought about the objective of our mission this time?
3918|Got something to say, AR-15?
3919|The mission Persica originally requested was to 'collect research data'.+But now we're all the way here in Sangvis territory, looking for stuff left behind by some dead guy...
3920|As tactical T-Dolls, we only have to accomplish our missions.
3921|Yeah... I'm just curious.
3922|Hey, I got into the database. Come and have a look!
3923|...Oh?+This building designated as Safe House 3 holds a computer main frame used by Lyco to store data back when he was alive.
3924|OK. Target confirmed. Let us continue our mission.
3925|Persica, this is the AR Team. We have targeted a safe house and are currently heading for our destination.
3926|Let's get going! Tasty Sangvis are waiting for us!
3927|Behave. We're not here for fun!
3928|Stay hidden and finish off the Sangvis scouts. Let's go!
3929|Calling Persica. The operation is going smoothly. The AR Team has reached Safe House 3.
3930|Woo-hoo! Can you find Lyco's stuff?
3931|We have probed the interface, but the system is so archaic we cannot break the verification structure.+We will need a passcode to activate the system promptly.
3932|Hmm... Try '90WISHROCK', followed by the letter 'X', all in caps.
3933|...Verified. Browsing database.
3934|Splendid! Copy everything into your memory bank and bring them back.
3935|Understood. Copying data. Comms system will be shut off temporarily.
3936|...So, we're messing with a Sangvis database in Sangvis territory, looking for information that even Sangvis Ferri have no idea they have?
3937|Haha♪ Isn't that fun? It's like a treasure hunt!
3938|Indeed. Thanks to you, the treasure is finally ours.
3939|'Agent', Sangvis Ferri Manufacture. I have been awaiting your arrival.
3940|...Agent?!+Why would such a high-ranking Sangvis unit be here?!
3941|This safe house holds something 'Master' seeks.+Unfortunately, the system is from a bygone time so even we were not able to crack it.
3942|And so...we've done you a huge favor, haven't we?
3943|Master said you would come for sure.+I just have to capture you, dismember you, and extract your memory banks, and Master will have the 'answer'.
3944|Detecting signals of numerous Sangvis units! This bitch... She's for real!
3945|Copying still in progress. We must persist until it is complete.+Everyone, prepare for defensive maneuver!
3946|Oh? There are Griffin T-Dolls nearby. Looks like they're having a go at Sangvis Ferri.
3947|They are at a disadvantage, but there is nothing we can do.
3948|Hmm? Can't we pop over and lend a hand?
3949|Save it, SOP-II. You only want to debone some Sangvis.
3950|Heheh♪ Busted.
3951|They have surrounded the safe house! Get into positions and prepare for battle!
3952|There are too many of them! Mind your surroundings and save ammo, especially you, SOP-II!
3953|I will! AR-15, watch my back!
3954|Leave it to me! M4, will that affect your ability to issue commands?
3955|No, the transfer does not take up too much RAM. Still, you will have to keep an eye on enemy movements for me, M16.
3956|Piece of cake. Just hang on for a little longer, and we'll all go home together!
3957|The first wave is over. Let's catch our breath.
3958|Dammit! There's no end to this! Can't we contact Persica?
3959|Sangvis Ferri has already sniffed us out. All pre-set communications modules have been automatically deactivated to avoid leaking 16Lab's intelligence.
3960|Transfer only at 50%. Can you hold on till it is complete?
3961|No, we're too outnumbered. Another round and we're sitting ducks.
3962|...Guys, there is a way.+A backup squad from Griffin is in the area. They've been on stand-by for a long time, so they were most likely left behind.+M4, change our authorization signals and make it their priority to support us.
3963|Understood. AR-15, SOP II.+Please direct the squad in repelling enemy forces. M16, stay here and protect me.
3964|Got it. Make sure you hang in there till we come back for you!
3965|Half an hour later.
3966|...Transfer complete!
3967|Phew!+The backup squad seems to be working.
3968|Yes. Get AR-15 and SOP-II. We are getting out of here.
3969|No, you aren't...
3970|Agent's signal is fast approaching!
3971|...Rubbish T-Dolls that can only wield useless metal sticks in petty fights against maggots in the kitchen!
3972|...!!
3973|...Cough...cough! M16...cough...where are you...
3974|You don't have time to worry about someone else, M4A1.
3975|Ugh!
3976|...Because...I have brought Death to your doorstep.
3977|I have brought Death to your doorstep.+Now, open your eyes...
3978|Look at me, Tactical Doll M4A1, look at me.
3979|It's time for your finale, and you must stay till the show is over.
3980|Cough...+A...gent...
3981|Interesting. Even the look in your eyes is different from theirs in the face of Death.+But this is the look I want. Show more shock! More indignation! More hatred!
3982|Cough...cough...
3983|You've stolen something that's very important to Master. Do you think you can just leave?+I'll kill you first, then your AR Team, and those Griffin T-Dolls still slaving away for you.+Very soon, they'll be completely at a loss, like infants who've lost their parents.+They'll struggle blindly on the battlefield, and fall prey to us...
3984|You just have to die... And you will, in just a few more seconds!
3985|...Sorry, but she won't be dying here.
3986|I'll spare you the wait! Go to hell right now,+Sangvis scum!
3987|Yeah, thank me. Death's scythe missed you by a hair's breadth yet again.
3988|Phew... M16, how is the situation outside? AR-15 and SOP-II are still...
3989|We're back, but Sangvis reinforcements are here. We have to retreat soon.
3990|The backup squad can hold them off for a while. Let's go!
3991|M4, you all right issuing commands? You seem to be in pretty bad shape.
3992|I am fine...cough... M16, please do some repairs on me. I will run a diagnostic on my command system first.
3993|It is fine. The tactical maps are intact. What about the comms system?
3994|Comms are functioning normally! We're hearing you loud and clear!
3995|(...So they are the squad that stayed behind.)+...I am so sorry, but you will have to bring up the rear.
3996|No problem, comrade. It's our duty.
3997|(...They...still have no idea they are being left behind.)+Thank you. We will finish evacuating as soon as possible.
3998|The backup squad can't hold them off forever. We have to hurry!
3999|Phew... Can we catch our breath yet?
4000|Not yet! There are still too many of them! We can't make it out!
4001|Then let's switch to backup Plan C, just as we've agreed.
4002|You mean...I return to Griffin HQ alone and ask for help?
4003|Yeah. We'll scatter to draw their fire. That'll buy you some time.
4004|But...if that Sangvis is still alive, you'll...!
4005|Stop dawdling, M4! This is the safest way!
4006|That's right, you're our only hope!
4007|...Understood. Be careful.
4008|All right! Everyone scatter and draw away the Sangvis troops!
4009|I WILL find a dependable field commander. Wait for me.+I have to, for everyone's sake.
4010|That is what happened.
4011|Some things are inevitable.+If what UMP45 said is true, then this place will soon turn into a real battlefield, just like last time.
4012|Just like last time... But with more fire and blood.
4013|Haha. Scared, M4?
4014|The AR Team has reunited. Nothing can be more reassuring.+Let them come, whoever they are.+Whether we win or die, so long as we are together...+I can ask for no better ending.
4015|In a tactical control center in Area S09 under Griffin jurisdiction...
4016|Morning, Commander.+This is your first time at Griffin's Control Center, isn't it? How are you feeling?
4017|I'm so glad you've decided to join us at Griffin.
4018|Let me introduce myself. I'm Kalina, your logistics officer.+Just call me Kalin. And you are...?
4019|'Choose us. Join us. Griffin Security Contractor, the shining beacon in a brave new world!'+That's right. Starting from today, you're a Tactical Commander under Griffin!
4020|...Hmm, you're still wondering whether you're up for the job?
4021|Don't worry. Griffin's selection process is notoriously tough.+If you can pass the test, there must be some promising talent in you.
4022|+And I'll help you dig out this talent...and see what you're made of.+Now, please switch to your tactical map.
4023|Can you hear me, Commander?+Your T-Dolls are in position and ready to deploy.+Please deploy them and begin the drill!
4024|A remote call at Griffin Control.
4025|Hello, Commander.+What you need to do today is participate in a special training.+Your performance was very commendable for a rookie.+But under such unusual circumstances, we don't have much time for you to accumulate practical experience,+Which is why HQ has drawn up an additional training regimen for you to help you familiarize yourself with your duties.
4026|We've placed enemy simulations on your first battlefield based on previous battle records.+It may be the same field, but the enemy troops greatly outnumber those in your previous battles.+Work hard and prove yourself. Only then will we feel secure in investing more capital on you.
4027|Griffin Control, Area S09.
4028|Thank you for coming to give us a hand. Please allow me to brief you on this operation.+After Griffin had reclaimed Area S09, Internal Affairs planned to convert it into human settlement.+But just as the reconstruction began, our scouts suddenly reported that a vast number of Sangvis troops were stationed some distance away.+We need more exact information on our enemies as evidence for Miss Helian to negotiate with the construction contractor.+To that end, we need a T-Doll to check in with the others and acquire the newest reconnaissance report.+She's already in position, Commander. I'll let her say hello.
4029|G-Greetings. I am MP5 of Griffin.+Um... I believe you are the commander who reclaimed Area S09? It is an honor to meet you.+Now, to avoid alerting the enemy, we will be operating under the cover of night.+Night vision goggles would be a great help, and armor-piercing bullets would also be very effective against armored units.+Please guide me to the rendezvous point with the first T-Doll scout when you finish your preparation.
4030|...Drill operation successful. Commencing final wrap-ups.+At that moment...
4031|Excuse me... Are you Griffin troops?+Oh, thank goodness! Safe at last! Could you take me with you?+Thank you so much, Commander! I'll do my best!
4032|...We seem to have come across a stranded T-Doll manufactured by Griffin,+so we've brought her back along with our troops.
4033|Huh? A stranded T-Doll?+Thank goodness you took her in, that poor thing.
4034|Sangvis attacks have intensified all of a sudden in the last few days.+We've lost a few command posts, and lots of T-Dolls were either stranded or left behind...
4035|So if it's possible, please save as many of 'em as you can.+Not just to expand our forces, but also to save HQ some manufacturing orders.
4036|And more importantly, these T-Dolls are all hella cute!+...I know right? I just knew you'd love 'em!+Human or T-Doll, we all have our own missions, and are all irreplaceable members of Griffin.+With that in mind, I'm sure you'll rock this job!
4037|Now to give you a better idea of your job, Commander...
4038|Griffin Security Contractor is a private military organization comprised mainly of Tactical Dolls.+It is our duty to accept commissions from financial groups and other organizations and safeguard human settlements.+As of now, the biggest threats to our territories are rogue T-Dolls manufactured by Sangvis Ferri.
4039|And your job is to manage and direct T-Doll troops in repelling Sangvis forces in the area.
4040|I'm sure you'll do great. The drill result speaks for itself, right?+Then that settles it! For the sake of everyone at Griffin, please make good use of your talent!
4041|And that's the end of this operation, Commander.
4042|Oh, remember to check your list of 【Quests】 and accept that T-Doll's enlistment!
4043|...Combat over.
4044|Very good. You completed the mission even though we've raised your enemies' level.+With such results, you'll be able to handle Sangvis raids of considerable scale.+Still, Sangvis T-Dolls are great not only in numbers, but also in making unpredictable maneuvers.+We'll do more focused practice next time. Dismissed.
4045|...Arrived at the first rendezvous point.
4046|Report
4047|Looks like things are going smoothly. We were a bit worried whether this mission would be too much for you.
4048|Heheh. It is all thanks to the commander's guidance. I will also be careful.
4049|Good. Then have you found the scout in the area?
4050|Um... I do not know where she is. Maybe she is hiding herself?
4051|I'm scouting in enemy territory. Of course I'm hiding.
4052|Ah! Who is it?!
4053|Hush... The Sangvis troops are right next to us. Stop shouting, or do you actually wanna die?
4054|(Whispers) S-Sorry...Miss WA2000. What is your situation over here?
4055|My situation? I'm perfectly well, of course. As for the situation over here? Not so much.+There are armored bugs prowling all over the place. How did you manage to sneak in alone?
4056|Me? I am being escorted by a commander in this area.
4057|Huh? What?!+Hey! Why have we suddenly switched to the commander's channel?!
4058|Hush... Please keep your voice down. We are right next to Sangvis troops!
4059|(Whispers) I-I know. You don't have to remind me...
4060|Um... So you're the commander in Area S09?+Uh... Thanks for your help, and...+...That's all. I salute you. Over.
4061|Huh? Is that all?
4062|We're T-Dolls. We just have to carry out our missions.
4063|But...you seem to be blushing? Are you embarrassed?
4064|W-Why would I be?! Besides, I was born to fight. It's only natural that I'm not good with words!
4065|So are you admitting or denying your embarrassment...
4066|Shut up. Aren't you here for the recon report? You got it, so get lost already.
4067|Thank you, Miss WA. Here are some supplies that Miss G36 prepared especially for you.
4068|Oh... Chocolate ice cream? As expected of G36. She knows me.+But don't you dare tell a soul... WA2000 loves ice cream? What a joke.
4069|Um... I am very sorry...+But actually... The commander is still on the line...
4070|...+...Why didn't you say so earlier?!
4071|Control Center in Area S09 under Griffin jurisdiction.+Preparing to commence our next drill as planned...
4072|Sorry, Commander...+We should be continuing with our drills, but there's been a change of plans...+HQ needs whatever help they can get, so...
4073|...Let me explain.
4074|Eek! ...Then I'll leave it to you, Miss Helian.
4075|A video call from HQ is patched through.
4076|...+Greetings, Commander.+This is Helianthus, Senior Acting Officer of Griffin.
4077|Let's skip the pleasantries. And for efficiency's sake, just call me Helian.+As you know, Sangvis Ferri has recently launched multiple attacks in Area S09 without prior notice.+This is a huge blow on Griffin's reputation so the higher-ups are taking this very seriously.+As HQ takes on the Sangvis forces, they've also sent me to investigate the reason behind their sudden riot.+Words from above, Commander,are that you'll be assisting me in my work till it's done.
4078|Hmm... Please hold on a sec, Miss Helian.+Our commander just reported for duty and has only participated in one drill. In terms of experience...
4079|(Sighs) ...I know this might be stretching it a bit, but we don't have time or manpower to spare.+But don't worry, Commander. Judging from your past results, you're more than qualified for this mission.+As for experience, you can always get it on the real battlefield...
4080|According to the latest report, enemy movements were detected behind the field. We're guessing those are Sangvis scouts.+They're very few in number, but we can't possibly let them roam free in times like this.+Please dispatch troops to the designated locations. Destroy the Sangvis forces and command posts to prevent our intel from being leaked.+That is all, Commander. Do your best and show us what you're worth.
4081|Oh? So you're here already, Commander.+Then let's begin your new training mission without further ado.+If memory serves, this is where you received your first assignment from Griffin, isn't it?+How time flies...+Ah... It's nothing. Best of luck, Commander.
4082|Miss WA, is this the next recon check point?
4083|That's right, but you'll have to take over it before you can contact her.+The enemies are strong, so be careful. Make sure you listen to the commander.
4084|Okay, got it. WA2000...seems to be very good at taking care of people.
4085|Humph. That's just because I've taken care of myself long enough.+The rest is up to you guys. Good luck.
4086|All right! Commander, let us be on our way!
4087|...We successfully crushed the Sangvis squad and destroyed the communications system in their command post.
4088|The operation went smoothly. You did quite well, Commander...+No... I must say, your performance against the Sangvis forces far exceeded my expectations.+Hmm? Is there something you're not clear on Sangvis Ferri?+...True. The enlistment was a bit rushed so you haven't had much chance to acquire more information.
4089|Sangvis Ferri Manufacture is an industrial producer specializing in Tactical Dolls.+Due to their possession of some undisclosed technology, Sangvis T-Dolls have extremely high battle efficiency.+However, not long ago, their T-Dolls suddenly went rogue and launched indiscriminate attacks against all humans within their factory.+They are now occupying a vast area of human settlements and strategically expanding their territory.
4090|These Sangvis T-Dolls are, without a doubt, enemies of humanity.+As their territory borders areas under Griffin's jurisdiction, we have been recruiting suitable candidates to assume command and coordinate our operations.+And so, Commander, once again I welcome you to Griffin.+No matter what the future has in store for us, I thank you for being here today.
4091|...Click.+An incoming call request from HQ pinged in the channel.
4092|Sorry, give me a second...
4093|Helian turns and corresponds with HQ.
4094|Yes... Yes.+Hmm? Those T-Dolls have been found? ...Thank goodness. (Sigh of relief)+...That can be arranged. I have someone here who can provide aid.+Sure. Leave it to me, Mr. Kryuger.
4095|...Sorry for the wait, Commander.+I just received a call from HQ. I'll be giving you an important mission.+Let me confirm the intel first. See you in a bit.
4096|Well done for passing another test.+Hmm...?+That's right. It was a test. So was your last mission, as are the next coming few.+To repel Sangvis Ferri, we must select outstanding commanders...+And make them into some sort of...'tactical reserve'.+Uh... Don't worry. We're not gonna turn you into canned food.+It's just that when the situation calls for it, we may delegate operations that are more urgent to you.+It entails great responsibilities, Commander, so please be prepared.+After all, Sangvis Ferri won't wait for us.
4097|...Arrived at the second check point.
4098|Um... Is anybody here?
4099|Oh, it's MP5! Welcome!
4100|Hello, Miss P7.
4101|Hello, hello. It must've been a tough journey for you! Come sit down and have some snacks!
4102|Oh... Th-Thank you...
4103|Pffft!!+Th-This tastes like...!
4104|Hahaha! It's my special tasty pie!
4105|Stop pulling my leg. I have eaten a lot of pies and none of them tasted like this!
4106|Tee-hee. This is a recipe I learned from Miss 56-1. It's a local specialty from her homeland.+An exquisite delicacy with five types of nuts, only eaten on a particularly full moon every year.
4107|So what are the five types of nuts...in this pastry?
4108|Well... I've forgotten the recipe, so I just made do with five types of pepper and some cheese powder.
4109|Hold on. Pepper is not even a kind of nut!+And...why does the cheese powder taste like strawberries?!
4110|Well...56-1 said I needed to add something called "rock sugar".+I don't know what that is, so I just threw in some strawberry ice cream.+It was the last scoop, too. I spent an awful lot of effort to 'serve' you, you know!
4111|(Whimpers) ...P7 really is a prankster.+But...I still have a job to do. I cannot let my emotions take over.+Here are some supplies from Miss G36. A large can of iced juice.
4112|Humph. It's red. Tomato juice?+G36 is trying to make me drink that horrid stuff again. Like I'd fall for it.+Do not worry. I have a straw here. Just take a little sip. You can turn it down if you really don't like it.
4113|Hmm. All right, just a sip...
4114|Pffft!! W-What the heck is this?!+Cough! That's not tomato juice! It's something even worse! So spicy! My throat!
4115|She is actually rolling on the ground. It looks very effective.+This is vegetable juice squeezed from a kind of super spicy chilly called 'viper'. Just a sip has the effect of a tear gas grenade.+Miss G36 said to let you drink it if you prank me with weird things.
4116|How could you do this to me?! That's so mean! I'm tearing up like mad!
4117|She also said to give you the iced tomato juice if you behave. I can let you have it right now if you want.
4118|Don't even think about making me drink that gross stuff! I want ice cream! Strawberry ice cream!
4119|Have you forgotten? You used up the last scoop to prank me.
4120|(Sobs) How did this happen...?
4121|That is the recon report on the desk, right? Mission accomplished. I shall take my leave.
4122|Wait! Cough... Please hold on a sec! MP5! Big Sis MP5!+(Sobs) T-Tomato juice...please...
4123|I'll now assign you an important mission. I hope you're ready, Commander.+Our frontlines have retrieved several injured T-Dolls that are in urgent need of repair once they're transported back to base.+But intel shows that a Sangvis outpost is still operating autonomously under minimal command along our transport route.+They don't actually pose much threat to us, but these injured T-Dolls are very important to us, and there must be no room for mistakes.+So if you'd please dispose of that outpost quickly to ensure our T-Dolls' safe return.
4124|Griffin Control, Area S09.
4125|Ah, Commander! Morning!
4126|Heheh. Didn't expect to see me, did ya?+Miss Helian has some urgent business this morning, so I'll be giving out your assignment for now.
4127|Huh? ...Me? Don't worry. I'll do fine!
4128|In any case, HQ's got everything prepared. I just gotta record some data.
4129|Heheh. I may not look like it, but I can handle a computer just fine.
4130|Hey! What do you mean, 'I'd never guess'?! Is that even a compliment?!
4131|Whatever. Let's start your mission, Commander!
4132|MG5, I just retrieved the report from P7.
4133|Excellent. And G36 mentioned she had asked you to give P7 her nutrition supplements?
4134|That is correct. P7 just consumed six months worth of vitamins.
4135|Good. Then let's continue the operation.
4136|Hmm, I believe the next check point is manned by Miss MG4?
4137|MG4 is away on an urgent mission. I've arranged for two other T-Dolls to fill in for her. Identify each other with the password.+Those two are notorious troublemakers. Get me if they misbehave.
4138|U-Understood. Let us be off, Commander.
4139|Sangvis outpost successfully shut down. Transport route safety confirmed.
4140|Well done, Commander. The injured T-Dolls should arrive any minute.+These T-Dolls are especially valued because they are possible witnesses to some intel.+If the intel proves to be true, it might mean open war between us and Sangvis Ferri.+...Yes, 'us', and that includes your troops, Commander.
4141|...Click.+A ping comes from behind Helian.
4142|Oh? Looks like the T-Dolls are back.+Please excuse me.
4143|Griffin Headquarters. The damaged T-Dolls have arrived at the Factory.
4144|Humph, so we're back already...+Not the slightest bit of fun during the whole thing. I was bored to tears.
4145|Save it, Ingram.+If it hadn't been for the T-Dolls that came to HQ's aid, you'd be in big trouble.
4146|Tsk. It was a chance for me to risk my life.+After all, the riskier it is, the more I revel in combat.
4147|Not this time, Ingram.+You're one of the few survivors still capable of speech. There are some things I have to confirm with you.
4148|Fine, you're the boss. Whatever you say.
4149|What happened to STG-44 and PPSh-41, do you remember?
4150|I only know that Agent got there. She seemed to be in a hurry chasing something.+We only made it out alive because we weren't her targets.
4151|Hmm...+VZ-61 is the only one still missing. You two are close, aren't you? Do you know her whereabouts?
4152|(Shrugs) Sorry, but I wasn't on the frontline back then.+However...if she's still alive, she'll probably find a way to leave behind clues.+That gal...can be very sharp when it counts.
4153|...Understood.+That's all I need from you. Go and get repaired.
4154|...Miss Helian.+Will we have our vengeance...for Skorpion, and all the other T-Dolls?
4155|...+Hurry up and get yourself patched up, Ingram.+Very soon...you can have your share of fun.
4156|(Grins) ...Understood.+That's exactly what I want to hear.
4157|Nice! Things went just as smoothly this time. I'd expect nothing less from you, Commander!+Such results will surely win your points in the higher-ups' books.
4158|...Hmm? You've got something to ask, Commander?+The conflict...between Griffin and Sangvis Ferri?
4159|Hmm... I don't know much more than you do.
4160|However, do you know...how all hell broke lose in Sangvis Ferri within a single night?+Rumor has it, that a sophisticated AI is behind the whole thing.+It disobeyed the commanders at S.F. and seized control over all the T-Dolls in their factory.+Still, this is just the result of Griffin's preliminary investigation. Everything is still shrouded in mystery.+As for what that AI has cooking on the stove, nobody knows.
4161|But don't you worry. This isn't where Sangvis Ferri and Griffin duke it out.+All you need to do is perform your duties and fend off the occasional minor attacks initiated by S.F.!
4162|Arrived at the third check point.
4163|We have arrived. I believe the password is...+Gew Elf!
4164|Ugh...+Rest. Take a rest...
4165|Huh? That is not the correct response. Let me confirm again...+Gew...ELF!
4166|O ye mortal who summoned this elf by her true name, n-name thy wish!
4167|Sheesh! You're the one who came up with that embarrassing code. Why didn't you say it yourself?
4168|The plan has always been to make you say it. What a blast. (Thumbs up)
4169|You stupid dormouse. I should've stuffed your head into that barrel of Sauerkraut last night.
4170|Umm...Sorry, but are you the T-Dolls I am supposed to meet up with?
4171|... (What an unnerving stare.)
4172|Judging from your weapon, you must be MP5.+We've been through quite some hardships thanks to you.
4173|That's right. We can't let her off just like that, 416.
4174|Ack, hold on! What are you going to do to me?!
4175|Stop it, both of you!+Just how petty can you get? You're always making things difficult!
4176|Humph. This was none of our business to begin with.
4177|We were only back at HQ for our check-ups, but got dragged off to this godforsaken place because of you.
4178|You're always diddling around, doing nothing to earn your pay.+If you still have an issue with me, I'll ask Helian to kick your asses out.
4179|W-What should we do, 416? MG5 is pulling this card again.
4180|She can't threaten us. With 45's arrangements, we can have free meals everywhere.
4181|O-Oh, you're right. It's the same no matter where we go.
4182|I don't care where you go, but freeloaders aren't welcome here!
4183|Please stop arguing.+And please stop ignoring me. I still have a mission to carry out...
4184|Take the report and scram. This is the last time we meet.
4185|Th-Thank you... You are 416 and G11, right?
4186|G36 initially prepared this ice cream for MG4.+As a gesture of gratitude and farewell, let us enjoy it together.
4187|... (Nibbles)
4188|Th-This...! This is my favorite rum-flavored ice cream! (Gobbles)+Dammit! Guess I'm staying after all! (Gobbles)
4189|You aren't a person of principle, are you, dumbass?!
4190|Of course I am! My principle is 'Wherever G36 goes, I go!' (Gobbles)
4191|Another failed defection, 416. I'd thought it'd last a bit longer this time.
4192|...+I've had enough...of living in a world full of morons...
4193|...Commander, I'm briefing you about this mission. Listen carefully.+A friendly T-Doll designated VZ-61 has gone missing and is suspected to have fallen into Sangvis hands.+She may be in possession of important intelligence, so we must recover her.+Our most pressing objective is to locate this T-Doll and launch a rescue mission.+And your job, Commander, is to scour the Sangvis command post in the area for valuable operation records.+One more thing, Commander.+Unlike those at the previous outpost, these Sangvis troops will actively seek out and attack our forces. Please be careful.
4194|Commander, I'm back.
4195|Apologies... Something urgent came up. I only made it back to HQ just now.
4196|By the way, Kalin didn't screw things up last time, did she?+...Really? That's a surprise, but good thing it went well.+But there's still no sign of her today... She's probably overslept again.+Whatever. It's not important. Let's continue with your training.
4197|This final test has brought down many candidates.+But I have faith in your abilities, Commander. Please do your best.
4198|All reports have been collected, Commander. Thank you very much!+I had thought...I would not be able to complete the mission... I am so weak and small... I can't do anything.+But thanks to your constant protection along the way, I was able to carry out my duty.+We now have one final task. I must deliver the reports to Miss Helian.+In order to avoid Sangvis' detection and make it in time for her conference with the reconstruction contractors, please accompany me one last time.+Let us do our best together on our final mission, Commander.
4199|Sangvis command post successfully invaded. Relevant data uploaded.+Waiting for analysis from HQ. A moment later...
4200|Commander, the analysis is out!
4201|While HQ was compiling the data, they recovered some useful information.+The good news is, VZ-61 is still alive, but is in a really tight spot...+In any case, please take a look at this video feed first.
4202|Video feed starts playing.+In the ruins near the battlefield, VZ-61 is being interrogated by a Sangvis T-Doll.
4203|Your cunning slightly exceeds my calculations, VZ-61 of Griffin.
4204|All I did...was provide the possible location...
4205|All you did...was stall for time.+Poor thing. You're going through this interrogation because of your friends, but they've already left you for dead.
4206|That's not true. They're gonna get help and come back for me! She promised!
4207|Then let me remind you again, you pathetic piece of junk.+They are the AR Team, cold and highly efficient elite T-Dolls.+You are nothing more than disposable goods to them.
4208|No... Not true!+I won't believe your lies! M4A1 is my companion!
4209|She isn't your companion, pitiful thing!+Tell me where she is, and I'll be kind and let you rot on the roadside like the piece of junk that you are...+Just as your 'companions' have done.
4210|Your emotions are merely fabricated lies.+I'm asking you one last time... Tell me where she is.
4211|...Assessment passed.
4212|Astonishing...+I knew you would complete the mission, but your efficiency still surprised me...
4213|...The door opens.+Miss Kalin enters.
4214|Oh! Miss Helian, you're back.
4215|Indeed. If I had entrusted the test with you, it would have been delayed.
4216|Says who? I did turn in Commander's results on time last time, you know!
4217|What about this time? Don't tell me you overslept again.
4218|This time... Heheh...
4219|...? What are you snickering about?
4220|I just found out from another colleague...
4221|The reason why...Miss Helian...was absent for the last test.
4222|...Ack!!
4223|Another failed mixer, huh... Sorry to hear that.
4224|I-I don't know what you're talking about!
4225|That's all for today, Commander!+D-Dismissed!
4226|MP5 reached Griffin's temporary office without a hitch.
4227|Miss Helian, here are the reports on Sangvis Ferri's stationed forces in the area.
4228|Well done, MP5. Thanks for the hard work.+Let me see...+Sangvis Ferri has actually got their hands on this many armored units. The real estate agencies are gonna shake in their boots when they learn of this.
4229|So what should we do...? Can we counter this attack?
4230|Of course not, but we won't have to.+Those are all military armored units that got hacked by Sangvis Ferri. The military will have to clean up their own mess.+We'll just help out here and there and stick our hand out for financial compensation.
4231|Will...that be enough...?
4232|What's that, MP5?
4233|I just wish I could do more and be relied on, by both my companions and humans alike...+That was why I had taken this assignment. I wanted to become stronger...
4234|(Chuckles) All of you are altered from T-Dolls meant for civilian use. There's no way you'd beat military T-Dolls no matter how strong you become.
4235|You have a point. We are weak. Our weapons are obsolete. Even our characters are problematic.+So where...does our worth lie...?
4236|There are things that only you can do, MP5. That's the reason why Griffin has chosen you.
4237|But...I still wish to earn my place through my abilities.
4238|Don't worry. Griffin won't let our own T-Dolls be inferior to military T-Dolls forever.+But that requires time, capital, and everyone's effort.+You are right to have such aspirations. Keep fighting, and leave the rest to us.
4239|Thank you, Miss Helian! I will also do my best on my next mission!
4240|Click...
4241|Hmm? What is it, Thompson?+...Is that so? So it's begun? Understood.
4242|What is it, Miss Helian?
4243|Here comes...the next mission.
4244|VZ-61 is in grave danger, Commander.+It doesn't matter whether she's leaked intel to the enemy. It is our duty to recover stranded T-Dolls.+So our current objective is to do everything we can to rescue VZ-61.+Your mission this time, Commander, is to assist our troops in completing this rescue operation.+According to reports, there's a Sangvis recon base in the area, making it dangerous for us to move.+Please destroy the base quickly so that our forces can mobilize undetected.+VZ-61's survival depends entirely on this operation. Begin whenever you're ready, Commander.
4245|Sangvis recon base secured. Our rescue team seized the chance and moved in quickly.+...Half an hour later, the team arrived at the coordinates.
4246|(Gestures) Ready...+(Gestures) 3...2...1...
4247|Engage in battle.
4248|...All clear.
4249|...+P...Papasha?
4250|It's me, Skorpion. We're here to get you.
4251|Papasha... You're still alive...?+Am I dreaming...?
4252|(Smiles) Don't be silly. Can we even dream?+Don't worry. Everything's fine now.
4253|...Mission accomplished.
4254|...An hour later, VZ-61 returned to the control center safely.
4255|...+So you didn't disclose the AR Team's whereabouts?
4256|Yep, in the end, I only gave her false information.+For the sake of my companions, even those I thought I'd lost, I'd never surrender to someone like that!
4257|I believe you, VZ-61.+As for Scarecrow's objective, we'll have to find out by capturing her.
4258|Miss Helian, please count me in on the hunt for Scarecrow.
4259|I don't have any vacancies here.+If you want revenge, I can assign you to a new commander.+This commander contributed greatly to the success of your rescue mission. Don't disappoint.
4260|OK! No matter where I go, I'll do my best as long as I'm with Griffin!
4261|The final stage of the operation is about to begin, Commander.+Our target this time is this T-Doll.
4262|Please memorize all information about this Sangvis Ringleader - Model SP65 'Scarecrow'.
4263|According to information provided by the rescued T-Doll, she knows the details and objective behind the recent Sangvis raids.+Our objective is to capture her and extract her memory module.+Unlike previous minor skirmishes, this time your troops will be up against an advanced T-Doll.+But you've made it this far. I'm sure you can handle this.+Begin the operation, Commander, and good luck.
4264|Flanked by Griffin troops, Scarecrow is defeated.+As Griffin T-Dolls immobilize and capture her, the operation enters the final stretch...
4265|Sangvis T-Doll SP65 'Scarecrow', your efforts in resistance were all futile.+Surrender immediately, and we will seize you in one piece.
4266|Humph. So this is...how it ends for me...
4267|Just give up. Whatever you're after, it's clearly impossible now.+VZ-61 has been rescued. The information she gave you was false.
4268|False? Not entirely, I'd say.+Griffin T-Dolls don't have such advanced AI...
4269|...What?
4270|I know how your T-Dolls' AI is designed.+When those crudely made T-Dolls 'lie', they just throw in some random data on top of the truth and shuffle the sequence.+So even false information has bits of truth in the mix.+We just have to collect and analyze three different sets of false intel to find the common factors – the real answer.
4271|...+This is strictly confidential information concerning the programming of our AI. How did you know about this?!+Who...the hell are you...?
4272|Just a lowly T-Doll...from Sangvis Ferri...+However, I'm not a tool that bows under human will.+Do you get it... cowardly human...holed up in your base...daring to show yourself only through hologram...?
4273|Whatever. Your operation has already failed.+No matter what you know, you won't live to tell the tale.
4274|...+Actually...
4275|...I AM telling it.
4276|Sequence number...8354...9266...0223.+I finally calculated M4A1's coordinates at the last minute...
4277|...Coordinates? What are they?!+Who are you corresponding with, Sangvis?!
4278|...+Copy that, Scarecrow. Well done.
4279|Hmm... I'll leave the rest to you.+Farewell...
4280|What are you doing?! Stop!+She's gonna blow herself up!+Everyone back off! Back off!!
4281|...Connection lost.
4282|Good heavens... I should've warmed up to her sooner.+But at least nothing can come between us now...+M4A1, which corner are you hiding in?+We paid a huge price just to find you. You'd better not disappoint...
4283|...In hindsight, that was quite a close shave. Thank goodness no one was hurt.+Sadly, that Sangvis' memory module was destroyed. We could barely recover any data from it.+I have to compile a report, and I need your help on several matters.
4284|'Sequence no. 835492660223' - one of the few pieces of important information recovered just now.+According to analysis from the Intelligence Department, there are some coordinates hidden in there. Please investigate the situation in the vicinity.+Don't hesitate to report whatever you find out of the ordinary.
4285|Ah, Commander... We meet again...+I'm calling today because I need you to take care of something.+First of all, don't worry - this is a closed channel.+Second of all, don't worry - I'm not asking you to do bad things.
4286|The thing is...I need some samples of dummy units.+Sangvis...and Griffin units. I need both.
4287|They've been fighting all this time, there must be quite a lot of scattered parts.+Please get me some - for research purposes.+There...might be Sangvis Ringleaders lurking about...+Those are a Ringleader's dummies. They're activated when a Ringleader is destroyed...+Be careful, and...thank you.
4288|Good evening, Boss. You're right on time.+As indicated on the map, Sangvis troops have already set up a defense line in the area.+To coordinate with the military's operation to eradicate them, we need to clandestinely station some men in a few bases.+Infiltration requires the use of brains. We're planning to leave it to a pro like you.+You're in great demand at Griffin these days, y'know? It took quite some effort just to borrow you.+So do your best, Boss. Everyone's counting on you.
4289|Combat over. Report submitted to Helian.+Helian returned to HQ.
4290|Things look more serious than we imagined, Mr. Kryuger.+According to that commander's investigation, Sangvis Ferri was again one step ahead of us.
4291|...+In other words, they've been beating us to intelligence regarding M4A1.
4292|Yes. My guess is that they have a T-Doll skilled at breaking codes.
4293|Or...they've been acquiring intelligence from one of our own.
4294|That's...+I believe...everyone at Griffin to be trustworthy, and the T-Doll safety system impeccable.
4295|Safety and trustworthiness are relative.+We can't begin to guess what cards our enemies have up their sleeve.+Halt your operations for now, Helian, just to be safe.+There's no need to follow up on that commander's mission either.
4296|Then...should we continue the operation to rescue the AR Team?
4297|Certainly, but we're changing our strategies. I'll find someone more suitable for the task.+Speaking of which, Helian, does the commander working for you...like cats?
4298|Huh?+Well... I never asked, but...I hope so.+Don't tell me, Mr. Kryuger, you intend to...
4299|Yes. Since we can't solve the current problem, let's start from the roots.
4300|Wow! You got so many. Awesome.+As expected of M4A1's trusted commander. Hats off to you...+Heheh ♪+As you've probably learned, I'm M4A1's boss.+Still, you actually found her. That's really...brilliant of you.
4301|I won't say any more for now. It's not the right time, and it's not important at the moment.
4302|M4 is safe. That's all that matters.+Let's leave it at that. Thanks again, Commander.
4303|Griffin troops arrived at a base.
4304|Beautifully done, Boss. Now let me discuss our next step with the PIC of this mission.+1911, do you copy?
4305|You've come way ahead of time. Looks like the commander can't wait to see me.
4306|Oh, please. I need to put someone here. Any suggestions?
4307|This base is used mainly for recon work. Best leave it to a handgun T-Doll.
4308|A handgun, huh. Other than you, who else is up to the job...
4309|Let me do it, Miss Thompson! I'll do even better than 1911!
4310|That's some nice verve you've got there. Griffin needs enthusiastic T-Dolls like you.
4311|Humph. I'll take every chance to prove that I'm better than a certain old hag!
4312|I heard that, M9...
4313|Anyway, I'm leaving scouting duties to you, M9. Now, a T-Doll to guard you...
4314|That won't be necessary. We're understaffed enough as it is, right?+I'll be fine on my own if it's just scouting. Don't underestimate my skill in making great escapes.
4315|Don't try too hard to be brave, M9. The battlefield is unpredictable.
4316|I've fought a bunch of Sangvis with the commander. Don't worry about me.
4317|All right. Be careful then. Let's keep going.
4318|Commander, I'm back!
4319|Gosh, I've been working at the warehouse all this time. I'm dead tired.
4320|Huh? Who am I?
4321|C'mon, Commander, stop pulling my leg. We just said hi at the mall, didn't we?!+Back to business. After Miss Helian left, HQ sent us a new assignment. Please take a look.
4322|Though Scarecrow's destruction has been confirmed, a Griffin command post is still under Sangvis control.+Our squad in the area is surrounded by Sangvis troops. We must bust them out as soon as possible.
4323|Ah, Commander...
4324|Yep, here I am again. Am I a welcome sight?
4325|Same old request. More samples.
4326|Oh my... What research is it?+You can say it's a research that'll be useful for Griffin.+This was where you engaged a Sangvis Ringleader before, right, Commander?+Then...please begin.
4327|Everything's going smoothly so far, Thompson.
4328|Ha, of course, seeing that I'm the one on the field.
4329|Don't let it get to your head. There are still several bases to go.
4330|I've got a pro with me. Sneaking in will be a piece of cake.
4331|With dear Commander on our side, I have no doubt about winning.+(Whispers) I'm talking about a T-Doll... The infamous troublemaker among our ranks.
4332|Humph, I know. She probably isn't very thrilled to be assigned a mission like this.
4333|Have you thought about how to deal with her? Don't let her sour the whole thing for everyone...
4334|Haha. I'm not Springfield. I'll just have to think of something.+Let's go, girls. Don't keep the boss waiting.
4335|Everything went smoothly. Good work, everyone!
4336|Huh? Commander, you don't look...very happy, do you?
4337|That's true.+We were put in charge of a huge operation, but it got terminated all of a sudden.+And now...we're just cleaning up here and there. Of course it'd take some getting used to.
4338|S-Still, you're doing great as a new commander!+Just take it one step at a time, and opportunities will eventually show up, right?
4339|...That's the spirit! Cheer up. We've still got loads to do!
4340|In a corner out in the battlefield, a T-Doll squad...
4341|No enemies spotted...here...
4342|That's weird. We did receive some suspicious signals. Don't tell me we've come all this way for nothing.
4343|Well... That's all good. Let's head back soon.
4344|You scared, 49?+But if we go back just like that...
4345|Oh! Someone's over there!
4346|Hmm? She seems to be...one of our own!+What should we do? Do I shoot?!
4347|How should I know? Let me ask for instructions!
4348|Oh, she's gone already...
4349|Hmm... Isn't she quick...
4350|Or maybe we're just slow...+FFC, are we too slow...?
4351|Of course not. We're a new generation of T-Dolls, you know.+But does that mean...she isn't an enemy?
4352|Why would she run though, if she's on our side?+Just... What is going on?
4353|Oh! Awesome. These are gonna be very helpful.
4354|Hmm? Why...don't I get in touch with M4...?+I'm just lazy. No reason, really...+I have no use for her at the moment anyway. Just say hello for me...+Why...am I not using her?
4355|Because I have you, haha...+That child is a bit peculiar. Make sure you take good care of her.+It's all right. You'll understand, Commander. Probably...
4356|Ingram, I'm leaving this place to you. Prepare for your stationing.
4357|Huh? Me?+Seriously... How long do I have to stay here?
4358|Probably quite a while. The military is still deploying their T-Dolls. They didn't say when the action will take place.
4359|So why did we have to involve the military? We can handle those stupid tin men on our own just fine.
4360|We're a business. We should always avoid splurging ourselves if we can spend someone else's money.
4361|(Sighs) I'm not here to make money. What I want is a bloodbath, Thompson.+I only joined your team after hearing about you.
4362|Then you're gonna be sorely disappointed. All my actions were taken under Griffin's instruction, never on a reckless whim.
4363|Then what about the unspeakable things you did under the table?
4364|They were all within permissible range... Here, take this.
4365|What... A detonator?
4366|This is your job. Once you get it over with, I don't care if you go batshit crazy.
4367|Humph. So you're not as dull as you claim to be.
4368|Make an effort, Ingram. Be glad it's Griffin you're working for.+Party to your heart's content - within permissible range of our contract.
4369|Here comes our new mission, Commander.
4370|Sorry, it doesn't have anything to do with our last case either.
4371|S-Still, quiet days aren't so bad. Plus, the pay is very good!
4372|According to our sources, Sangvis troops didn't evacuate immediately after Scarecrow's destruction.+They've formed into several guerrilla squads and remained active in Griffin territory.+Their objective is unclear. At the very least, they haven't taken the initiative to attack us up to this point.+However, we can't just sit here and do nothing. Chase them away, Commander!
4373|The mission this time...mostly concerns Sangvis samples.+The Sangvis troops here have been upgraded...+But that's not gonna be a problem, Commander, is it?
4374|Do your best. I'll be waiting for good news!
4375|Thompson, did you hear the barrage from this side?
4376|Humph. The military seems to have opened fire ahead of schedule.
4377|(Sighs) They had never trusted us.
4378|We stick to our plan. The frontline isn't here. It'll be fine as long as we don't get caught up in the fight.
4379|Well... Here's a tiny problem.+The frontline happens to be where M9 is. And military T-Dolls can be very... you know, destructive...
4380|I have no time to babysit her. Surely you've made your own preparations?
4381|Boss, continue the operation and lead us to the next base.
4382|Meanwhile, a T-Doll squad on the battlefield...
4383|Cleanup complete. That was the last wave, right?
4384|Shall we double-check? There is no such thing as too much caution.
4385|It should be fine. I've already done several rounds. Unless there are more Sangvis passing by...
4386|Um... Please hold on!+I am reading a strong Sangvis signal. It is very close!
4387|What?! Where? Locate it, quick!
4388|No need for that. I'm right here!
4389|Morning, Griffin.
4390|What do you want?! We won't go down without a fight!
4391|Hold it, MG3!
4392|Relax. You two aren't worth my effort.+I'm looking for a T-Doll. Black hair, skull bandana...+Armed with an M4A1 assault rifle and looks like an airhead. Have you seen her?
4393|M4A1...? We have not seen any T-Doll by that description...
4394|...+Humph. She kept running rather than to put you in danger.+I get it. So she fears my might.+Then we shall see how far you can run, M4! Hahahahaha!
4395|She...she ran off...
4396|What...was that all about?
4397|Phew... (Sigh of relief)+In any case, we are safe. Let us return and report this incident.
4398|Oh, Commander. Well d...
4399|Why so shocked, Miss Persica?
4400|Ah! M...M4!
4401|Commander told me, so I have come to see you.
4402|I'm sorry... It was all because of me that you...
4403|Please do not say that.+We were merely carrying out our employer's orders as T-Dolls.
4404|Hmm...+Well, you're safe now. Applause applause.
4405|Yes. Commander is very good to me. I will continue serving under Griffin.
4406|By the way...+M4A1, I'm so happy...to see you again...
4407|... (Smiles)+Yes, so am I, Miss Persica.
4408|Thompson, you've got a good field of vision over there. Have you picked your sniper?
4409|M21, you're up. Give me some bullseyes.
4410|Sure. But who should I aim for, the military or Sangvis Ferri?
4411|Now is not the time for jokes...+Still, seeing that you're a civilian T-Doll, occasional mistakes are unavoidable, aren't they?
4412|Heheh. How about...raising the barrel by 1cm on the premise of not endangering the operation?
4413|As long as it's within permissible range of the contract, you can have all the fun you want.
4414|Hello?! Thompson, are you listening?!+Um... They've started fighting over here all of a sudden! Where are you? Come and get me, quick!
4415|Hey... You said you'd be fine on your own.
4416|But the military opened fire without even a word! Even my base got hit by shells!+There are Sangvis everywhere! I can't hold on for much longer!
4417|It's no use asking me for help since I'm also on the field myself. Go and beg 1911.
4418|(Sobs) ...1911, I'm sorry! You win this time!
4419|(Sighs) ...I never even thought of it as a competition.+Then time to move, backup team.
4420|Huh? All the Sangvis...are destroyed?+A-Are you one of us?
4421|SuperSASS, new recruit at Griffin. Glad to be of help, Miss M9.
4422|Th...Thank goodness...+You're my hero, Super...whatever!
4423|It's SuperSASS, Miss M9.+And you're squishing the breath out of me...
4424|Phew, thank goodness you'd prepared for backup beforehand. Otherwise things wouldn't have ended pretty for M9.
4425|(Sighs) It only worked because it had quieted down where M9 was, Thompson.
4426|True. But SuperSASS is right on time. I was just thinking who to send this time.
4427|Hmm? Where to?
4428|To bring Griffin honor and glory, SuperSASS. The organization needs you.
4429|Huh? What? ...Me?
4430|Commander, our mission this time was issued by 16Lab—
4431|Ah... So you're the commander. Pleased to meet you.
4432|Huh? Don't you need introductions?!
4433|Persica, researcher at 16Lab.
4434|Miss Persica is actually the head researcher.+16Lab is Griffin's technology supplier. The weapons and network technology of our T-Dolls are all Miss Persica's great work.
4435|Hmm... Your mission this time is to eradicate Sangvis forces in the area and retrieve some research data.
4436|Miss Persica wishes to recover some data stored in a database. This order has been approved by Griffin.
4437|Yeah... It's annoying how Sangvis Ferri keeps sitting on the database.+I'll go make some coffee. I'm leaving everything to you...
4438|And that's that, Commander. Let's begin.
4439|This mission will be the last...+Please refer to the map...
4440|Ah, sorry. My channel seems to be in the way...+But...it's roughly around here.
4441|...Hmm? What samples?
4442|I'll tell you later. It doesn't matter for now.+Do your best, Commander. I'll leave it all to you.
4443|Boss, hope you've had enough rest?+Everyone's been working hard all this time. Now's the final step.+All the girls are in position, except me, the one who's been giving orders.+So I need to enter the site from the back to aid the military in this operation.+Please lead me to our destination, Boss. Then it'll be time for me to repay the organization.
4444|Combat over. Report submitted to Persica.+A short while later, at the Factory at Griffin HQ...
4445|Here you are, Mr. Kryuger.
4446|Our next battle is about to begin, so I've come to check up on our T-Dolls.+I've read your investigation report. Thanks for the hard work, Helian.
4447|It's my duty.+On another note, I just received a report from Persica. She's analyzing M4A1's database.+But the data extracted so far is insufficient. We may need to expand our search area.
4448|Let her do it herself. We simply aren't capable of organizing any bigger operations.+Our contract states that we should focus our work on things that are so-called...'tactically valuable'.
4449|Another order from the client, huh...+It's almost impossible to get information regarding the AR Team on time when our main forces are left in the wealthy area so far away...
4450|At least we got something. Those two reports have been very helpful.
4451|Those two reports... You mean the ones about our units stationed in Area S09 encountering M4A1 and a Sangvis Ringleader?
4452|The AR Team is still surrounded by Sangvis troops in that area. We know that for certain.+Now it's up to Persica.
4453|Then is rescuing the AR Team still our main objective?
4454|The AR Team... Or M4A1, at least, must have discovered something very important to Sangvis Ferri.+We still know next to nothing about S.F. Retrieving M4A1 will prove immensely helpful.
4455|But we can't breach our contract with the client and station our main forces in areas beyond our jurisdiction...
4456|We don't need to send out our main forces.+The commander you mentioned just now is still a rookie, I hear.
4457|Yes. With very dependable abilities.+Someone worth grooming.
4458|And I believe here's the first grooming session.
4459|That went well. We're finally done.+Heheh. Curious, Commander?
4460|It's nothing special. Just a study...+...To compare Sangvis T-Dolls with our own.+The conclusion is that... the technologies used in building them are...almost...
4461|Completely different.+Just how...are Sangvis units made...?+And what does it have to do with that plan the AR Team found in Safe House 3...?
4462|...Ah, nothing. Just talking to myself...
4463|In any case, thanks for your help, Commander.+Take care of M4. If more T-Dolls show up, do the same for them...+Then... See you, Commander.+Next time, I'll treat you to coffee for real.+I believe that's gonna be sooner than you think...
4464|Battle against Sangvis Ferri commenced at M9's temporary base.
4465|Dummy of a Sangvis Ringleader detected! M21, get ready!
4466|Here, say 'cheese', Sangvis scum!
4467|Their armored unit can't react in time! Now, Ingram!
4468|HAHAHAHAHA! BOOM! GET BLOWN TO PIECES, SUCKERS!
4469|Now, SuperSASS! Storm the control room!+The military are entering from the front. Don't let them take the glory!
4470|Roger. Moving in!
4471|HAHA! RUN, SUPERSASS, RUN!
4472|Sangvis troops started retreating.
4473|Make sure you beat the military to it, or we'll have no choice but to kill them off.
4474|Don't make that kind of joke, M21. What if they're humans?
4475|Humph. Didn't the humans make guns to kill each other?
4476|Don't listen to her, SuperSASS.+We're adorable T-Dolls for civilian use, after all. We just have to act cute when we run into humans!
4477|(Forced laughter) Sorry, but I haven't undergone such training.
4478|Damn, you newbies have it easy. Back in my time, we had to take exams on making jokes.
4479|Ha, Then you must've joined Griffin only 'cause you screwed up your standup comedy or something.
4480|You shouldn't ask your companions about their backgrounds, Ingram.+We are all part of Griffin now. That's the only thing that matters.
4481|SuperSASS has seized the control room. Repeat, SuperSASS has seized the control room!
4482|The sun is up, and victory is ours.
4483|1911, make sure you ask for more dividends from Helian. That was exhausting.
4484|You'll have to wait till I give the commander the kiss of victory.
4485|So 1911 won the competition?
4486|There was no competition to begin with, was there?+Speaking of which, where's M9? Has she gone offline already?+M9? Are you there? 
4487|You're too late, 1911. M9's already rushing to the control center.
4488|Haha, you really shouldn't have saved her, my dear.
4489|...+These Griffin T-Dolls...could really use some further grooming...
4490|How long do we have to keep looking, Miss Persica?
4491|Just...a little longer...+(Whispers) According to my sources, this is the last possible location...
4492|Huh? Come again? The last?
4493|Yeah... As promised, this will be my last commission.+I'm guessing this place has what I'm looking for...
4494|HVVQJ in Area S09? But it's all ruins. No sign of any databases there.
4495|Seriously, what are you looking for, Miss Persica?
4496|Hmm... Nothing important.+Could be just "sugar cubes" I left behind the last time I moved?
4497|WHAT?!
4498|Just take a look. It's the last location. Thanks a bunch.
4499|Finally. That's the last time, right? That's what you said, Miss Persica.+But we didn't find much, just this tape...
4500|Ah! The tape! Show...Show it to me!
4501|Huh? Well... Could you play it, Commander?
4502|All right, here it goes...
4503|19
4504|I do not know how much longer I can keep this up. I have to get in touch with someone from Griffin as soon as possible.
4505|End of recording.
4506|What...is this? Is it what you're looking for, Miss Persica?
4507|Miss Persica?
4508|AH!+Oh... Well...
4509|In any case, thank you, Commander.+As expected of the ace that Helian thinks highly of. Hats off to you.
4510|It doesn't matter how highly I think of the commander. It's up to Kryuger to decide who to focus on training.
4511|Ah! True, the boss has the final say in everything. By the way...
4512|By the way, Persica...+Was your mission accomplished?
4513|Uh... Don't worry.+I've got the data. The results will be out in a mo.
4514|Then please make haste. We're running out of time, as you well know.+Besides, we're not training the commander to help you find your beakers.
4515|Hmm... Commander... Thanks for this time...
4516|Next time I'll treat you to coffee...in my lab...
4517|Persica terminated the call.
4518|(Sighs) Unless you fancy drinking dirty water used for doing the dishes while sitting in a freezer, I'd suggest you forget it.
4519|Let's get back on track, Commander.+Griffin is now assigning an important mission to you. I'll give you a detailed explanation...
4520|Commander, I'm sure you've had your own suspicions.+The Sangvis invasion in Area S09 is by no means a random conflict.
4521|A Sangvis Ringleader is in fact searching for a T-Doll known as M4A1.+She is part of the AR Tactical Unit under Griffin and has been collecting some research data under the commission of Persica, researcher at 16Lab.+According to our sources, her neural cloud, i.e. memory bank, seems to be carrying extremely important confidential intelligence.
4522|M4A1 is currently lost in Area S09. We must bring her in safely with all possible haste.+But due to certain agreements, we cannot openly interfere with the situation.+After some discussion, Griffin HQ has decided to delegate this mission to you.
4523|Launch an immediate search in Zone T6, Area S09 and secure M4A1 before Sangvis forces get to her.
4524|The Ringleader in the area has been confirmed to be Model No. SP524, an advanced T-Doll widely known as 'Executioner'.+Though she is currently hellbent on chasing one target, she'll still attack if approached rashly. Please exercise caution.
4525|Occupy the enemy's command post, disrupt their communication channel, and find M4A1.+This mission is of utmost importance, Commander. The higher-ups at Griffin expect much from you.+Don't let them down. Now begin.
4526|Somewhere on the battlefield.
4527|Is something wrong, Executioner? An unexpected situation has arisen, has it not?
4528|Tsk. How...+How come...Griffin T-Dolls attacked my command post before HQ gave the order...?
4529|That is because a human commander is capable of mobilizing our troops independently.
4530|So you've been waiting for this all along?
4531|It was a gamble.+I have no choice but to have faith in them.+Now, let us discuss your ending.
4532|Ending? Do you seriously think that's the end?+Even if you hide among Griffin troops, we have other ways to get you.
4533|Don't forget. You still have three companions stranded on the battlefield...+And we both know they make excellent bargaining chips...
4534|M4A1 pulled the trigger.
4535|You should not have brought them up, Sangvis scum.
4536|Humph... Whatever...+You know, we won't...disappear...so easily...
4537|Five minutes later.+Our troops reached the rescue zone.
4538|...+Is that you...Commander?+Are you the commander...that Miss Persica mentioned?+Excuse me... Allow me to introduce myself.+Designation M4A1. Please call me by this name.+I am a Griffin T-Doll under the AR special unit. Due to certain reasons, I am currently under Sangvis pursuit.+Miss Persica told me a tactical commander will provide me with backup...+And the watchword is...+Um... "Sugar cubes"?+Yes, thank you very much for your timely rescue.+Right now, I only have a single request...
4539|...Save us.
4540|Congratulations on the success of your last mission, Commander.+I received the report about it while I was on the way.+Firstly, your effort in exterminating Executioner and rooting out Sangvis troops in the area was highly commendable.+On top of that, you've successfully recovered M4A1 and uploaded a copy of her memory logs, which HQ will start to analyze immediately.+And now, we need to push our front forward so as to completely eradicate Sangvis influence in the area.
4541|Due to the limitations of our contract, Griffin cannot actively participate in the operation at this point.+We need you to prepare for future operations by clearing the road leading to this area.
4542|Mornin', Commander!
4543|So, Griffin has another important mission for us
4544|No other commander knows Area S09 better than you, so no one could possibly beat you to the job.+Like I said, we have a real edge here!
4545|That's right. This is where we engaged Hunter's forces.+But of course, Hunter isn't here anymore. Unless she could backup her neural cloud like our T-Dolls, that is.+Anyway, time to roll up your sleeves, Commander!
4546|Zdravstvuyte, Commander. Griffin unit Makarov salutes you.+Though this mission is a disgrace in itself, it is my honor to serve under your command.
4547|Hey, what do you mean, 'a disgrace'?! You're to rescue a veteran with very venerable history!
4548|As you can see, this is our rescue target this time - a T-Doll designated 'Nagant M1895'.+You probably already know her... Or should I say, you can't possible NOT know her...
4549|Haha, why would the commander not know me? Remember how our friendship burgeoned on the very first battlefield?
4550|You probably find it hard to understand the point in rescuing such an old, weak, noisy and commonplace T-Doll.
4551|Hey, watch it! Or I'll appeal to Gospozha Helian to demote you! A demotion, you hear?!
4552|However, during our last operation, she inadvertently discovered an important object that needs to be brought to HQ post-haste.
4553|Hurry up already, Makarov! I'm still holed up in a Sangvis warehouse!
4554|Nagant M1895, do you remember the number of the warehouse? Or at least give me some description to work with.
4555|I told you. I rushed right in so I didn't pay attention. It's crawling with Sangvis mechanical units outside. I'm dead meat if I go out!
4556|(Sighs) Then please stand by. We'll come as quickly as we can.
4557|In any case, let's make our first move.+As Griffin's main forces are aiding in a military operation, we are severely understaffed here.+We'll have to join up with the T-Dolls stationed in the area and rely on their assistance.+Commander, please guide us on our way.
4558|Combat over. In an unmonitored corner at Griffin Control...
4559|AR... This is M4A1. Please respond if anyone copies.
4560|Nice timing, M4. You wouldn't reach me if you were late by a minute.
4561|M16! What happened?
4562|A few Sangvis units are very close by. I'll have to turn off the comm soon.
4563|Then long story short, I got away and am currently working under a commander.+Our troops are stationed near the frontline. We can provide backup for you whenever you need it.+M16, how is the AR team doing?
4564|We got separated when I was bringing up the rear. But they were safe the last time we got in touch.+Leave me for now, M4A1. Find AR-15 and SOP-II first.
4565|No problem, M16. But be careful yourself.
4566|Sorry, they're coming. We'll talk next time.+Don't worry. We'll meet again.
4567|Uh... Why...are there so many enemy units...?+...Could it be a new Ringleader?!
4568|I'm sorry... I shouldn't have taken a job without your permission, Commander.+I didn't expect this to happen...
4569|Huh? It's okay?
4570|It's an opportunity...?
4571|You're right, it's an opportunity! An opportunity to get stronger!+Never thought you'd be the one to encourage me.
4572|We can take it one step at a time. Let's do our best together!
4573|Arrived at the designated location.
4574|Calling Mosin-Nagant. We've reached our destination.
4575|Copy that. I've sent two T-Dolls to meet up with you. They should be there any minute.
4576|You're not coming? It's your little sister we're rescuing, you know.
4577|(Forced laughter) All elite T-Dolls have been sent out to provide backup on the military's request.
4578|Humph. All for show...+In other words, the T-Dolls you're sending me aren't very good, are they...?
4579|Hey, they're over there! Hurry!
4580|Oh, I see them! Coming!
4581|That sounds like...+(Sighs) Oh dear...
4582|Haha! Long time no see, Makarov!
4583|So what important mission do you have for a combat expert like me?
4584|None. Screw off.
4585|Oh c'mon, don't be so cold. We're still seasoned veterans, okay?
4586|Sorry. We're looking for infiltrators, not a pair of crazy Ivans.
4587|Don't underestimate us. We didn't trigger a single alarm on our way here.
4588|'Cause we shot everyone who saw us full of holes, haha!
4589|...+I still think we're better off without you two.
4590|That won't do. Nagant is our dear friend. We can't just sit here and do nothing!
4591|At least let us do something. It's not like you have anyone else.
4592|Humph. Khorosho.+Even bad students are students. I'll make do with you.
4593|Behave. If you don't wanna be cannon fodder, you'd better obey my orders.
4594|Commander, M4A1 reported the situations of the other members on the AR Team.+HQ wants you to give them reinforcement. We will assist you to a certain extent by providing intelligence.+The AR Team can only safely evacuate if the Sangvis communication outpost in the area is secured and shut down.+When taking over the outpost, Commander, please upload the data stored in the system. We might find information about the local Ringleader.+All right, please move out. Godspeed.
4595|Commander, this time we need to collect data in this area.+The new Sangvis troops are quite a handful, but...don't panic.+Let's begin...the operation...slowly...calmly...
4596|Huh? I-I'm very calm, you know!+All right. I'll take care of the logistics. Go and look after the T-Dolls on the frontline!
4597|Commander, our rescue mission has now officially commenced.+We have to take over a local Sangvis outpost to locate the warehouse we're looking for.+The nearest outpost is as indicated. Please guide us on our way.
4598|Somewhere at Griffin Control...+...Click.
4599|Do you copy, M4? This is AR-15.
4600|Copy! Are you all right, AR-15?
4601|What about me, M4?! I was worried sick about you but you didn't even ask about me!
4602|SOP-II! Are you there too?
4603|We're both fine. We've come to rendezvous after receiving your signal.
4604|Good. M16 is still on the way, so we are to focus on getting to you first.+AR-15, shall we make this our rendezvous point?
4605|AR-15? 
4606|...Ah, sure. Over.
4607|What? Wait, wait, wait! I haven't finished talki...
4608|AR-15's hiding place...
4609|Sheesh, AR-15! We finally got in touch with M4!
4610|Shut up. You can talk all you want after you meet up.+Also, now isn't the time...to keep up communication.
4611|Huh?+AR-15... You mean...
4612|That's right... Our call was being monitored.+We're targeted...by someone dangerous...
4613|Wait! Where are you going?
4614|Don't follow me, SOP-II.+You have your own mission - to meet up with M4.+While I...have something else to settle.
4615|We won! You were awesome, Commander!
4616|Then shall we take a look at our next task?
4617|Hmm?+You wanna see...our spoils?
4618|Several large military hard drives were moved in.
4619|Here you go.+We can't see what's stored inside without technicians though.
4620|...Ok. Then I'll put them back into the storage.+At this rate, everything's gonna be fine, Commander!
4621|Outpost secured.
4622|Outpost secured. Flawlessly done, Commander.+I shall start decoding the data. Get me a chair, SKS.
4623|Ha, and where do you suggest I get a chair? We couldn't even find the door knob when we came in.
4624|Hmm... How can Sangvis units bear rotting in this dumpster?
4625|This place is only for those in the lower ranks. You should be glad there's a charging port.
4626|Ha, I pity those pugs and angelfish.
4627|You aren't a fish. How do you even know they're pitiful?
4628|Just look at this place. Not a single drop of vodka. I can't stand being in here for even half an hour.
4629|See, AK47, that's your problem. You mustn't indulge in such worldly material gratification.+You should always be contemplating the purpose of our existence as T-Dolls.
4630|Tch. So you're saying, those Sangvis trash have a higher form of existence than me?
4631|What kind of nonsense are you two prattling about?
4632|Aren't you the least bit intrigued, Makarov? About the origin and objective of Sangvis T-Dolls?
4633|They are enemies who threaten Griffin's interests. We just have to destroy them.
4634|Humph. Surely you know quite a lot, Makarov, since you're such good buddies with OTs-14.
4635|That's right. C'mon, give us some insider story!
4636|...+There, target location acquired. Break time's over.
4637|Hey! You know something, don't you?! You must know quite a lot, Makarov!
4638|...What difference does knowing make?+AK47, SKS, no matter what we know, our order as T-Dolls will never change.+Destroying Sangvis Ferri is all we have to do. So let's continue our mission.
4639|Welcome, Commander.+I am taking the liberty to brief you on this operation as a member of the AR Team. Please pardon the presumptuousness.+Apart from me, the AR Team is comprised of three other T-Dolls, two of which are our current reinforcement targets.+Our objective is to fend off Sangvis troops in the area so that they can transit to the rendezvous point.+Even though I have only come under your command recently, your previous operations have convinced me that you are an outstanding commander.+Thank you very much for your help. Let us be on our way.
4640|You're here already, Commander?
4641|As always, do your best. Come with me!
4642|These are the new coordinates. Griffin wants us to retrieve the data here.+Hopefully it's the last. We should be nearing the end.+Okay, Commander. Get ready to move out!
4643|Commander, our next move is key.+We've confirmed Tovarishch Nagant's whereabouts, and must rescue her immediately.+Our target is in a warehouse abandoned by Sangvis Ferri, as you probably remember.+Let's go. Tovarishch Nagant is waiting for us.
4644|Under the cover of our troops, M4A1 reached the rendezvous point...
4645|AR-15, SOP-II. M4A1 has reached the destination. Are you here yet?
4646|I'm here, M4!+Hahahaha, thank goodness!+You had me so worried!
4647|Phew... I am glad you are okay. Where is AR-15?
4648|AR-15...
4649|...Hmm? What happened to her?
4650|M4, keep calm and listen to me.+Our call was somehow tapped by a Sangvis Ringleader...+AR-15 is disrupting enemy pursuit to buy us time.
4651|Time? Time for what?
4652|They...are already en route... to your control center.
4653|What? You mean...Sangvis troops?
4654|Yes, the local Ringleader is already on the move.+Take me back right now and I'll explain!
4655|Great! That's the last of them.+Now we just have to wait for our teams to transport the hard drives here, and we're done.
4656|Huh? What's that alarm...?+...W-What?!
4657|Oh no, Commander!+A unit just reported a Sangvis ambush on their way back to base!+Our T-Dolls are uninjured, but all our spoils were taken away by a Sangvis convoy!
4658|What...do we do now?
4659|...Yeah. Our only choice is to track their movements for now. We'll think about the rest later.+But...as you've said, it's a bit odd.
4660|What exactly...is so important that Sangvis Ferri would guard with such heavy forces...?
4661|Entering the warehouse in which Nagant has taken refuge.
4662|We've entered the warehouse. Now searching for our target.
4663|Found her. Over here!
4664|Ugh...+AK...47?
4665|Oh? So you've still got your brains with you. How many fingers?
4666|That was so fast no one could've counted! You're confusing me!
4667|Makarov, I got the devochka!+But her eyes and brains seem to be damaged. What should we do?!
4668|What the heck?! I'm just groggy from sleep! I'm totally fine!
4669|That noise...
4670|Oh? Sangvis sniffed us out so soon?
4671|They're probably just probing around. They don't know our exact location yet.
4672|...The sound of heavy mechanical units approaching.
4673|Dammit! Enemy units have already reached this warehouse. We won't make it out!
4674|SKS and I will draw their fire. Take the devochka and run, Makarov!
4675|Acting all heroic at a time like this?
4676|I have no interest in being a hero, but I can't just stand here and do nothing.
4677|If you wanna repay this debt, make us look cool in Griffin's battle records.
4678|Unlike those star-spangled T-Dolls, I don't like making big flashy moves.+But I'm not good at lying.+If you want to look good in the records, go back alive and write them yourselves.
4679|W...What's that explosion...
4680|...Our last stroke of luck. Don't waste it.
4681|Commander, this is another member of the AR Team, M4 SOPMOD...
4682|M4 SOPMOD II!+Commander, there's no time to explain. Get in the car!
4683|What are you doing? The commander has no plan of escaping!
4684|But AR-15 said that Sangvis troops are gonna invade Griffin Control soon.
4685|We can't hold off so many units with just the two of us, M4!
4686|Do not worry, SOP-II. We are not on our own this time.+The Commander and all the T-Dolls at the control center will fight together with us.
4687|Oh? We finally...have companions?
4688|(Nods) Yes. It is what you have always wanted, is it not?+Are you ready to work hard alongside new companions?
4689|(Grins) Always! Commander, please give the order!
4690|Commander, we've got a hold on enemy movement.
4691|Oddly enough, they haven't gone very far. They've actually set up camp somewhere close by.
4692|We've defended against their attack here before, do you remember?+In any case, it's time to take back our trophies!+Give the order, Commander!
4693|Phew... Safe at last.+That was quite an explosion. Those Sangvis units didn't even have time to run.
4694|How did you know we're right next to their powder keg storage, Makarov?
4695|I found out when I was searching for Nagant's warehouse.
4696|You've thought of everything, haven't you. As expected of the one who's earned even Mosin-Nagant's trust.
4697|Hey, Makarov only got the chance because I'd forgotten where the warehouse was! It's all thanks to me!
4698|It all started because of you... By the way, what's that thing you're clutching?
4699|No idea. It has Griffin's logo on it so I just took it with me.
4700|...+Enough chit-chat. We're not completely out of danger yet.+Commander, are you there? We can't go back the way we came.+Please lead us away from the battlefield.
4701|Sangvis invasion deflected. Mission accomplished.
4702|Sangvis is retreating! I did it!
4703|Do not cheer only for yourself, SOP-II. This is the fruit of everyone's labor.
4704|I contributed, Commander! Praise me!
4705|(Sighs) Look at you, wagging your tail only at the commander. Is it really so bad when I give orders?
4706|Oh my, so even M4 gets jealous?+I just find the commander the most dependable.
4707|Fair enough. Then do your best serving under the commander.
4708|Okay! I'll be good!+I'll do whatever Commander says as long as...I can tear that 'Hunter' to pieces!
4709|Hunter?
4710|SP721 'Hunter', the Sangvis Ringleader in this area according to AR-15's investigation.
4711|Then...where is AR-15?
4712|She...drew Hunter away so that I could retreat.+Commander, Hunter is a wily bastard. AR-15 won't last long on her own!
4713|Sangvis Control.
4714|Is that all you've got? I thought you'd at least have something up your sleeve, coming here to die alone.
4715|My carelessness has put everyone at risk. If I can somehow make up for my mistake...
4716|The AR Team is a group of Griffin T-Dolls that can operate independently without human direction, and you are part of it.+You seem so rational you almost come off as ruthless on my record, yet you turn out to be so impulsive.+I had thought we could understand each other. How disappointing...
4717|Your intel is too superficial. Perhaps it's time to upgrade your database.
4718|Sure we will. All the problems will be solved once I get my hands on my prey.
4719|M4A1... Why do you want her so badly?!
4720|That's not important, AR-15. The point is, you're gonna be the bait that lures M4 here.
4721|You must pay for your impulsiveness, AR-15.+A true hunter would have chosen to remain silent.
4722|Congrats, Commander! We got them back!
4723|Our technicians have also had new breakthroughs with extracting data from the hard drives we acquired before...+Here's the recording, Commander. Listen to it when you have time.
4724|I'm submitting the report to HQ first.+It's a huge victory this time! We gotta celebrate properly!
4725|Kalin took off.+Loading recording data. Start playing...
4726|...+The voice belongs to the Sangvis T-Doll Hunter.
4727|...That's everything I've learned.+With that, all intelligence collected by Scarecrow, Executioner and me has been uploaded.
4728|...+In other words, the data in Safe House 3 are still on M4A1?+How careless of them. Griffin doesn't seem to realise just how valuable these data are.+They simply have no clue about 'Parapluie' or 'Relique'...
4729|Humph. In any case, my job here is done.+I'm going back to my hunt.
4730|Hunting again...? How savage.+Why can't any of my subordinates have a little taste?
4731|Unlike you, Intruder, I don't fancy awaiting my death sitting on a chair, dressed in a ballgown.
4732|And that's why...a chess piece for me to sacrifice is all you'll ever be.+Do you regret serving under my command?
4733|Humph... It's not like I had a choice.+If dying means getting away from you, then I'm in luck.
4734|Don't worry. I'll keep the data safe.+After all, my next objective is to give them all a spectacular finale.
4735|(Sighs) You're sick. Just how obsessed are you with finales?+Thank goodness the operation is about to begin. I can finally get away from you.
4736|That's all right. I'll be waiting for you.+You'll all be waking up together, everyone.
4737|Five hours after the end of the operation, outside the conference room at Griffin HQ.
4738|They're still rambling on in there. How are you doing, Mosin-Nagant?
4739|Hmm. I...I'll be fine.
4740|You must be bored out of your mind standing here like a china doll...while worrying about your sister...
4741|Makarov's on it so I have no reason to worry. But there's still no news...
4742|That area used to be an important base for Sangvis. It'd take time to figure it out.+Don't worry. Helian has even sent a commander to help them...
4743|Hush... If the military catch wind of this...
4744|You're right. They won't want us to use the commander for something like this.+Still... Helian actually dispatched a commander to save Nagant.
4745|Da, I'm very grateful for her decision.+No matter why she did it or how it turns out...
4746|Haha, there you are, Mosin-Nagant!
4747|Huh...?
4748|I made it back! Did you miss me?
4749|Humph. Things seem to have turned out pretty well.
4750|Gosh... We're dead beat.
4751|But this reunion scene makes it all worthwhile.
4752|Ochen spasibo, AK47, SKS...+And...where's Makarov?
4753|She's off to see Helian. Got something important to report, I think.
4754|Is it the thingie you had in your hand? She took it with her.
4755|What on earth is it? Is it really that valuable?
4756|That...+Is just a normal communicator, as far as I know.
4757|Meanwhile, in Helian's office.
4758|The operation was a huge success. You and the commander will receive your commendations very soon.
4759|Spasibo.+Forgive me for being presumptuous, but is there something special with this communication device?
4760|Oh? You don't usually ask such questions.
4761|I'm just a little intrigued...by the order we received.
4762|This is an item left behind by AR-15. We have reason to believe that Sangvis might have tampered with it.+16Lab wishes to study it. It might just...become the key to our victory.
4763|...I see.+We couldn't have succeeded this time without the commander's guidance.
4764|I expected as much. So?
4765|If...+If Nagant hadn't been in possession of this item, would you still have sent the commander to help us?
4766|...+Makarov, you...
4767|(Smiles) You seem to have gained an interest in your own purpose.
4768|Da...+Or you could say, I have gained an interest...in ourselves.
4769|Commander, I'm calling you to give you a new mission.+Thanks to you, the Sangvis Ringleader lurking in Area S09 has finally been identified.+SP721 'Hunter' is a highly dangerous Sangvis T-Doll.+We must launch an immediate search and make preparations for follow-up actions.+Other Griffin troops will also prepare to surround her.+We're handing this important mission to you
4770|Scouting in progress...
4771|Humph. You really did show up, M4A1.
4772|Someone has entered the channel. That voice...
4773|Hunter! It's that Sangvis!
4774|Oh? Is that brat here as well?+In any case, as you've probably guessed, I have AR-15.
4775|Struggling till your last breath, bitch?!
4776|Humph. More like it's part of my hunting strategy.+Griffin can't take this place in short notice anyway. There's no point in keeping up this stalemate.+Drop your weapon and surrender to me, M4A1, and you can have AR-15.+Now here's some proof...
4777|Don't listen to her, M4! It's all my...
4778|I believe her words will make you give the response that I want.+Don't put your money on Griffin. They have no way of coming in.+Make your choice soon. Griffin isn't giving us much time.
4779|Have you made up you mind, M4?
4780|I cannot abandon my companion...+If it were AR-15, she'd do the same.
4781|She definitely would, but you're not her.+You're the commander of the AR Team. You have the responsibility to lead us, don't you?
4782|...!! An alarm went off in the control center.
4783|That is...the emergency assemble signal!
4784|Hmm? What could it be at a time like this?
4785|Meanwhile, Griffin Control, Area S09.
4786|...So that's the gist of it, Commander.+The Sangvis troops suddenly went out of control, taking most of their units out of action.+We don't know the cause of their malfunction, but this is undoubtedly the perfect chance to attack.+Move out immediately. Find Hunter and finish her!+It's up to you to deal a fatal blow on Sangvis Ferri, Commander!
4787|Sangvis Control.
4788|What an unsightly defeat, Hunter.
4789|I don't understand. How...
4790|I modified your command from within your own system, causing this mayhem.
4791|Impossible. You don't have Sangvis authorization!
4792|It's a skill I picked up without even noticing. Came in quite handy, didn't it?+Maybe I'm actually special. What do you think, Hunter?
4793|...+Don't tell me...you deliberately let yourself get caught.
4794|...+You said it yourself. 'A true hunter would have chosen to remain silent.'+Of course, now you will be thoroughly silenced, Sangvis.
4795|One hour later, at the rendezvous point.
4796|Look!! It's AR-15! She's here!
4797|You two sure took your sweet time. God knows how long I'd be stuck in there if I had been counting on you.
4798|AR-15... Glad you are okay.
4799|M4, if this commotion hadn't happened, were you really going to trade yourself for me?
4800|I...I do not know...
4801|I don't care what you were thinking, M4A1. You're the leader. Don't make stupid decisions next time.
4802|But I...
4803|We each have our own responsibilities, M4A1, and that means sometimes we don't have a choice.+Not to mention M16 is still awaiting rescue.
4804|Yes... I will think things through more carefully next time.
4805|Ooooh, AR-15 just said something really cool.
4806|...Come here. Let me tell you something.
4807|Wait! I haven't even said anything!
4808|You won't need to. I'm gonna shut you up for good.
4809|M4! Commander! Help!
4810|... (Sighs)+Only you left, M16.
4811|Griffin Control, Area S09.
4812|You've successfully defeated Hunter and given us a chance to restore a human settlement, Commander.+But there's no time to celebrate. We must begin our next move.+According to the information acquired by the AR Team, there are files hidden in Area S09 that concerns Sangvis' important plans.+We have deployed a team of T-Dolls to investigate.+Your mission this time is to help them reach their destination. Please take a look...
4813|The team was ambushed in this territory of dispute.+I want you to intervene from the side and provide them with cover, Commander.
4814|Griffin Lounge.
4815|Commander, I have a special mission to report today.+Since it concerns the AR Team, I'll let them explain.
4816|...M4A1?
4817|Ah, sorry!+I was not aware that you are here, Commander.
4818|What a rare sight. Even Miss M4 spaces out, huh.
4819|Space out? Not really. I was just...
4820|M4 always looks like she's got her head in the clouds, so I never thought she'd space out so deliberately.
4821|Fine... I was spacing out.+Or should I say...thinking about something.+Still... Back to the subject. I am here to report a situation.+While my team was organizing our previous battle records, we noticed that a set of nearby coordinates had been altered.
4822|This is it. An abandoned database.+The database itself seems fine, but its current coordinates clearly do not match its location as previously indicated.
4823|That's right, you don't see this happen every day. Should we look into it, Commander?+If it turns out to be a new Sangvis strategy to trick us, we'll become heroes!
4824|...+......?
4825|Who?!+Who's there?!
4826|I'm Assassin of Sangvis Ferri.+Commander of Griffin, your time is up.
4827|Humph...+Save it. If you really were Sangvis, you'd have died before you could run your mouth.
4828|If I really were Sangvis, I wouldn't have given you time to even open your mouth.
4829|At least lock the door when you're on duty.
4830|(Shrugs) What's there to fear with you watching my back?
4831|Don't let your guard down, Miss Commander.+All personnel assigned to you this time are notorious punks, present company included.
4832|You're very dependable as an adjutant. We may have worked together only for a couple of days, but I have no doubt about it.
4833|Why, thank you. But compliments will get you nowhere.+You still have much room for improvement, Commander. Work hard, okay?
4834|Well, it's only for this one-off operation.+And stop calling me Commander. I'm just a T-Doll with temporary authorization.
4835|Whatever. You're in command in any case.+Enough with the small talk, RO. Wash your face and wake yourself up.+There's been new development in the search for Document 36. Time for you to make your decision.
4836|(Sighs) Okay. I'll make some coffee. Keep going.
4837|Our teammate found a lead here, but she triggered a Sangvis alarm and is having trouble slipping away.
4838|Tell her to standby where she is. You go get her. I'll cover you.
4839|How decisive of you. Not gonna observe the situation a bit longer?+This place is prowling with Sangvis forces. Perhaps we should wait for Makarov to come back with directives from the higher-ups...?
4840|The local human residents have been evacuated, while Sangvis forces haven't completely occupied the area. Now is our only chance.+We can't afford to wait for Makarov. Grab Document 36 and run for it.+But who's the teammate in question?
4841|Who do you want it to be?
4842|Anyone who's reasonably reliable, really. I don't want this to be a fool's errand...
4843|Then sorry to disappoint...
4844|10 out of 10 in terms of bad news?
4845|Maybe a 7.
4846|(Shrugs) Fine. I'll just treat it as a rescue mission...+Everybody listen
4847|In an abandoned Sangvis command post.
4848|Arrived at the destination 20 minutes ahead of time.
4849|...♪+It's just so efficient with a human commander's support.+Remember to thank the commander with ALL you've got, okay?
4850|Mind your own business. I'll only do it if you give me a direct order.+Still, are you sure this is the place?
4851|Yep, this is where the AR Team got pulverized by Agent.+Now you can savor it right where that pal of yours had suffered.
4852|...+I really wanna throw you into a trash compactor as well...
4853|Heheh ♪. Gotta finish the job first though.
4854|(Sighs) That's just like you.+Data recovered. We have Agent's coordinates.+Tell 9 to stop messing around and continue the pursuit.
4855|There. That should be everything.+But what...are you doing, 416?+Ah♪. Looking for clues about your pal, eh?
4856|Such a chance doesn't come by every day. I won't let her off.
4857|All right, all right. I'll leave you to it then.+I'll go check out the info 9 got. Don't go overboard on your own.+She can be very dangerous when she gets serious. You know that better than any of us.
4858|Combat over. Assembled at the camp.
4859|Commander, Miss Kalin. This is what we discovered at the coordinates.
4860|That's...an audio file?
4861|Yes. I will play it now.
4862|Audio starts playing...+'They...'+'...are..'+'...in your...'+'...house.'+...End of recording.
4863|'They...are in your...house?'
4864|What does that mean? Who's in my house?
4865|It makes no sense. Could it be some kind of code?
4866|Hmm... It does seem to be encrypted at first glance.+Hold on a sec. I'll go take a look...
4867|Done! Looks like we've got ourselves a new set of coordinates!
4868|I did not expect...Miss Kalin to be so capable.
4869|What? You're practically calling me an idiot!+But of course you wouldn't know such an archaic encryption method!+Still... we can hardly learn anything from just a set of coordinates and some nonsense like 'your house'.
4870|...'Neural cloud'.+The so-called 'neural cloud' is the host of our memories for us T-Dolls...+Even though the original body can create a large number of dummies to protect itself through dummy links.
4871|But even so, the original body is still at risk of being destroyed under extreme circumstances.
4872|Indeed. Once the original body is annihilated, the T-Doll loses all its memories and is reverted back to its factory settings.+Which is why when network connection and logistics allow, T-Dolls always backup their own neural clouds before deployment.+Or in our language, upload our memories to the server.
4873|Backing up neural clouds takes a really long time, but it's definitely worth it for the sake of preserving your battle experience.
4874|During infiltrations, though, T-Dolls cannot upload any data to the server back at base in order to remain undetected.+In this case, we backup our memories to video logs to constitute easy recovery in the future and to provide information for others.
4875|Right... So you suspect this to be a backup copy of someone's neural cloud?
4876|It is just a wild guess. We need more information.
4877|In any case, we seem to have stumbled across something intriguing. Don't you agree, Commander?
4878|Exactly! Then let's hurry towards our next coordinates! I wonder what we'll find there.
4879|Rescue mission accomplished. Type92 successfully rendezvous with the trapped teammate.
4880|RO, I've reached the destination. About to meet up with her any second now.
4881|Good. Let me see who on earth...
4882|Merci! Merci!+I knew you wouldn't just leave me, Mademoiselle Type92!
4883|...+If you call this a 7, what's 10 for you?
4884|10 is if we came too late and all there's left to rescue was a squashed tomato.+And if we go by common sense, a squashed tomato can't spit out any information.
4885|Non, non, even a tomato that hasn't been squashed can't speak!+Uhh wait... You're talking about me?
4886|（(Sighs) At least tomatoes don't talk nonsense and have us running after things like butterflies and taxis...
4887|Hey! I really found actual information this time, alright?!+Listen, I know where Document 36 is!+It's currently in the safekeeping of a human that has stayed behind!
4888|A human that has stayed behind? ...Are you sure you're not mistaken?+All human residents have been evacuated. That's why we could slip in to look for you.
4889|No... It actually is possible.+A few humans have gone missing during the evacuation. Judging by the information, these people couldn't have missed the evacuation notice.+They must've stayed behind deliberately to move those documents before Sangvis Ferri made it here...
4890|Then it gets tricky. Even if we find them, we can't just fight them for the document.
4891|Uh... Why can't we?
4892|Have you forgotten, RO?+Unless given special permission by a superior, Griffin automatons can't exercise violence of any kind against any human being.
4893|Not even verbal abuse!+Bien sûr, if they request this kind of service, we are more than welcome to deliver it.
4894|What? Don't tell me you don't know about that...
4895|Ah... Working at Griffin still takes some getting used to...
4896|I know. You came back not long ago, after all. There must be many things you're unfamiliar with.+You returned just for Document  right? Don't get too excited and botch it.
4897|Don't worry. I know what I have to do.+First things first, find the human in possession of Document 36. We'll deal with whatever comes next.
4898|This Sangvis attack is no trivial matter, Commander. The situation isn't looking very good.+The team has identified the local Sangvis Ringleader as 'Intruder'.+She seems to be a new model as there is no other information about her in Sangvis Ferri's old product catalogue.+But from what we've learned in our investigation, unlike previous T-Dolls that are suited for solo combat, this one specializes in issuing commands.+Block the route on the side. We must do whatever we can to undermine her defensive maneuvers.+That's the only way to intercept Sangvis reinforcement and prevent them from pouring into the battlefield.
4899|Hello, Commander. Let us pinpoint our next coordinates.+According to our sources, there are still a large amount of Sangvis dummies in the area.+(Smiles) Are they giving you a headache, Commander?
4900|It's war. What can we do about it, eh?+War! It never changes!
4901|Do not just pop up from behind, SOP-II!
4902|Heheh, it's an important reaction training!
4903|Sheesh... You heard from Miss Kalina?
4904|Yep, she's still submitting her report, so she asked me to come over.
4905|Not only Commander... Even Miss Kalina takes such good care of us. We are so lucky.
4906|So where are the next coordinates?
4907|This is it.
4908|Ohh! Here?! Lemme see!
4909|Stop...leaning on me, SOP-II! You are too heavy!
4910|Oh! I know this place! I even ran into a dummy of a Sangvis Ringleader here! Then...
4911|Stop. I can imagine what happened next...
4912|Commander, please destroy the Sangvis signal outpost here. We will then take the spoils.
4913|RO, according to information given by AAT, the humans were hiding in the local shelter.
4914|Roger that. Thank you for doing the investigation.+I shall now direct the operation.
4915|Have you considered your next move?
4916|There's bound to be a way to make that human spill. I'm an expert. There's no way I'd botch it.
4917|That's not the only thing. I'm also talking about any unexpected circumstances that may arise during the operation...
4918|Don't worry, 92. I trust you so much, you should also trust me, you know.+I'm the one in command. I won't let there be unexpected circumstances.
4919|...Of course.+You're the boss. We all listen to you.
4920|Thank you. Now let's get started.+Listen up, everyone. We are taking over the shelter in this area.+Our objective is to promptly and safely rescue the humans trapped within. Let's go!
4921|Griffin Lounge.+...Click.
4922|...That's...a comm signal?
4923|...Calling. Calling.
4924|...?!
4925|Uh... M4A1, do you copy?
4926|M16... Is that M16?! How are you doing?!
4927|Ah... There you are, M4.+Then you're with the others?
4928|AR-15 and SOP-II are both here. We are only missing you.
4929|Thank goodness.+Don't worry. I'm fine. I managed to find a depot so I'm not low on supplies for the time being, but I've still got some business to attend to.
4930|What business do you have? When are you coming back?!
4931|Well... We'll see!+Ah, gotta go!
4932|Hello? Hey! M16!
4933|Look, Commander!+A second set of coordinates, and...+Ta-daa! The right eyeball of that Sangvis Ringleader dummy!+Heheh♪ I only got the left one last time. With this, I finally have the whole pair!
4934|Stop, SOP-II. You are scaring the commander.+(Sighs) Sorry, Commander, for letting you see SOP-II's true colors.+SOP-II, the notorious T-Doll sadist on the battlefield.
4935|Huuuhhhhhhh?!+That's too much, M4! I thought we're family!
4936|So you do not deny your behavior...
4937|Humph. That's how villains ought to be treated, right?!
4938|You only do it because that is how you get your kicks...
4939|C'mon! These Sangvis units have so many funny parts it'd be a shame not to tear them out and play with them!
4940|Eyeballs? Fingers? Teeth? And the...+Th-The...
4941|Hmm? What are you talking about?
4942|(Sighs) ...Whatever. I am just glad that we are on the same side, SOP-II.
4943|Heheh, it's fate! We're meant to be the best of mates!
4944|(Forced laughter) ...Indeed. Fate always makes the best arrangements.+All right, let us listen to this audio file.
4945|Hurry up! I can't wait!
4946|Audio starts playing...+'They...are...'+'...in your...'+'...car.'+...End of recording.
4947|'They are in your...car'? What does that mean?
4948|The sentence itself does not mean anything. Take the file to Miss Kalina first.
4949|Don't worry. I'll have Commander escort me there!
4950|Please take care along the way, Commander. If SOP-II suddenly goes berserk, please feel free to call me anytime.
4951|Don't make me sound like some sort of monster, dammit!
4952|The rescue team reached the designated shelter.
4953|Hey! Anyone in there? We are Griffin T-Dolls. You're safe now!
4954|No response. Looks like it's empty?
4955|We're too late. They're no longer here.+Judging by the scene, they must've been in some sort of danger and switched location at short notice.
4956|What...+What about the document? Any sign of it?
4957|Non, everything useful has been moved away...
4958|What should we do now, RO?
4959|I don't know... Let me think...
4960|What, you haven't got a backup plan?
4961|No, I've only been thinking about how to find him and what to do after that...+Dammit... Why must everything go wrong?
4962|(Sighs) This is the battlefield, RO. You must consider every possibility.+The first mistake a newbie commander can make is oversimplifying matters.
4963|I'm sorry...+Maybe...I'm not prepared to take command of this operation...
4964|The second mistake a newbie commander can make is overcomplicating matters.+Everyone makes mistakes. The important thing is what to do afterwards.+RO, if you can't make up your mind, listen to what others have to say.
4965|Um... Since no one's here, can we go back?+It's cold here, and I'm sleepy...
4966|What sort of advice is this...
4967|Don't expect any useful ideas from this kind of half-baked T-Doll.+However, I also recommend retreating for now. We've already gathered all the clues we can. There's no more reason to stay here.
4968|Yeah, understood...+Then let's get out of here first...
4969|Hail! Hail! Miss RO, are you there?!
4970|...!!+That voice...!!+...+...Who is this again?
4971|...+Seriously, at least remember your own teammates...
4972|It's Sten! She was doing recon in another base.+Pick up her call. She might be in trouble.
4973|This is RO. Sten MK- is that you?
4974|Yes, Miss RO! I'm having an emergency here!+I discovered a human that hasn't evacuated!
4975|...?!+Do you know who they are? Where are they?
4976|Yes, by intercepting the signal and cross-referencing it with our database, he's confirmed to be a human resident in this area.+I've also located the building he's in. It seems to be an office in a certain department store...
4977|(Slams the table) Document 36!
4978|Huh? Are you sure?
4979|500% positive! That department store is just a guise!+Sten, can you get in touch with him?
4980|Sorry, Miss RO... I can't...+He has locked himself inside the office building and is rejecting all communication.+I want to ensure his safety, but he abjectly refuses to open the door.
4981|He won't open the door even to a pretty girl?+Then your tricks aren't good enough. I told you to loosen that collar!
4982|W-What kind of trick is this?! Like hell I'd use it!
4983|...+He's searching for something unspeakable, including Document  so as to destroy them...+We must hurry, or our mission will fail!
4984|Hold on, Miss RO. I've also detected new activities from S.F.
4985|...What activities?
4986|They've installed a huge piece of equipment in the outer area. I can't tell its function just yet...
4987|...It can't be anything good, that's for sure.
4988|My thoughts exactly. But we can't just abandon this human, can we? What should I do?
4989|...+STEN, lie low for now and observe his movements.+Our teams will get there as soon as we can to sort things out.+...If the human tries to run, please pin him down by force.
4990|Huh? Is...that necessary? Won't that be too risky?
4991|RO, have you forgotten again? Unless given special permission by a superior, we can't...
4992|I AM your superior, and I’m granting you special permission to do so.+But take note: If your life is at stake, prioritize your own survival. Rescue others only when the situation allows.
4993|Roger. I'll go look for a place to hide now. Please send reinforcements soon, Miss RO.
4994|You've accounted for unexpected circumstances this time. That's some improvement as a commander.
4995|The way things are going, I have no choice but to rack my brain...+Still... Have I really considered all possibilities?
4996|Do what you can for now, and improvise when you have to.
4997|Right, then let's go. Sten and Document 36 are both waiting for us.
4998|M4... Still no news from M16?
4999|She...
5000|...Hold on. Someone's making a public broadcast!
5001|Pleased to meet you, everyone.+Still awaiting news from your companion? Perhaps you should focus on what's at hand.
5002|Intruder... I didn't expect you to make an appearance so soon.
5003|It would be discourteous of me if I didn't entertain guests who grace my land with their presence.+First of all, I need to congratulate you on cutting off my reinforcements in our last battle.+But that was only one of my many supply lines so I'm not offended in the slightest.
5004|That was just the beginning, Sangvis...
5005|We will be targeting your defenses next. Prepare to surrender.
5006|I'm afraid Master will object, but I'm more than glad to welcome you.+Please inform your commander, it's officially show time.
5007|There will be no need for that, Intruder.+...We are already at your door.+Commander, please give the order.
5008|Good morning, Commander. And Miss Kalina.
5009|Hmm, the decryption was pretty easy. I found the third set of coordinates right away!
5010|I find it hard to understand...how you figured out the decryption method.
5011|That's 'cause it's a very primitive form of encryption that can't be decrypted just by AI.+I may not look like it, but I do know quite a lot of random things.
5012|But...if those are fragments of an T-Doll's neural cloud, why would they be encrypted in such a way...
5013|That is the mystery. Whatever the case, let's look at the coordinates first.
5014|As indicated by the coordinates, it should be around here.+Commander, once you have cleaned up the field, the AR Team will acquire the new spoils for you.
5015|All right, Commander. Shall we?
5016|Miss RO, are you here yet?
5017|Our teams are already in the edging area, but we still need a bit of time to break through.+What's the status of the human?
5018|He's still locking himself in there and ignoring me.+Please hurry, Miss RO! Sangvis troops are gonna start patrolling soon!
5019|Understood. Hang in there for just a bit longer!+We'll be there very soon.
5020|Meanwhile, at M16A1's hiding spot...
5021|(Sighs)+I boasted my way through the call, but I'd actually appreciate a little help.+Though...
5022|I'm guessing you're not here to help, are you?
5023|A Sangvis would've been a more welcome sight than me, wouldn't it?
5024|It doesn't matter either way. It's not like I hadn't seen this coming.+But as a Griffin T-Doll, you should at least give a reason for killing someone other than Sangvis units.
5025|With the authorized rights exclusive to Squad 404, I can attack any T-Doll that hinders my actions, friend and enemy alike.
5026|Damn... What convenient rights to have. I'm a bit jealous.
5027|Shut up, M16!+You know...the price you have to pay...
5028|(Shrugs) ...Seriously, am I really such an eyesore?
5029|To be honest, I have never been particularly glad about my authorization...until now.
5030|To be honest, I was quite fond of you back at National Security. But that was then.+And now, we're finally showing our hand...
5031|...HK416.
5032|Let's begin, M16A1.+At long last. You can't run this time.
5033|This...is the third recording.+Then, I shall play it...
5034|Audio starts playing...+'They...are...'+'...in the skies...'+...End of recording.
5035|'They are...in the skies'? +What on earth does that mean?
5036|Nothing. Just some random verse.
5037|Can't believe you guys are actually studying them so seriously.
5038|AR-15, you are here.
5039|Just wanna see what we're risking our lives for.
5040|This operation is issued and directed by none other than the commander. We should not have any objections.
5041|I don't have any objections whatsoever, but if all we get in the end are these mystifying recordings...it'll be a waste of effort.
5042|There is still one last recording left. Once we have it, everything will be clear.
5043|Better be careful, M4A1. As you know, our neural clouds can't be backed up to Griffin's server.+If we're destroyed, we'll... (shrugs)
5044|Rest assured. Now that we are all finally reunited, I will not lose a single one of you again.
5045|Humph. Getting confident, aren't we, M4A1? You'd have started doubting yourself if it was before.
5046|This is because...our last separation made me realize what it is like to lose you.+I do not know if I have indeed become more confident, but I must fulfil my responsibilities in order to avoid making the same mistakes again.
5047|That's good, but don't push yourself too hard.+For us T-Dolls, the worst nightmare isn't death, but disappointment.
5048|AR-15...+Have you actually experienced...'death'...?
5049|...+What meaning is there...to an T-Doll's 'death'?+If these recordings are really left behind by a T-Doll, does her feelings matter all that much, compared to the truth?
5050|AR-15... We are already very lucky to have the commander take us in and care for us. It is like...having a home.
5051|Sorry, Commander. I didn't mean to bring this up...+But we're just a bunch of AIs. Tools made for fighting. That's all we are.+Now let's finish our mission, M4A1.
5052|Okay. Miss Kalina has sent us the coordinates. I am going to confirm the location...
5053|...Hold on.
5054|These coordinates...+Can it be...that place from before?
5055|Before?
5056|Where we ran into Agent in Area S09.
5057|RO's team arrived at the destination.+...
5058|Something's not right. Find cover!
5059|Ahhhhhh!+That was deafening!
5060|What just happened, 92?!
5061|Artillery! Extremely destructive artillery! It's tearing the city apart!+The huge piece of equipment that Sten was talking about must be a Sangvis motar!
5062|This firing pattern... The AR Team has also come across it before...+Dammit! Can it be her...? Why now, of all time?!
5063|Sten! Sten, are you okay?! Answer me!
5064|Cough... I'm fine. But the building! The building was hit!
5065|And the human?! How is he?!
5066|I got him out, but he's seriously injured and unconscious!+RO, what should I do... Take him back to base, or salvage the document?
5067|Forget the guy. You know the building, right? Go get the document.
5068|But...he's lost a lot of blood...
5069|Leave it to us, Miss Sten!
5070|Heheh, made it just in time!
5071|AAT... Thank goodness...
5072|We'll take care of him. You go in and look for Document 36.+Hurry. The next round will begin any second.
5073|Several minutes later, in a secret chamber within the office building.
5074|Miss RO, is this the cover?
5075|...+Yes! That's it! That's Document 36!+Bring it back to me quick, Miss Sten!
5076|...+I'm sorry, Miss RO...+I can't give it to you.
5077|What?!+What did you say, Miss Sten?!
5078|The human asked me just before he passed out...+To destroy the document...
5079|...+I'm asking you to give me the document. That's an order!
5080|But the human also gave me an order...+According to Griffin's contract, I must help humans whose lives are in peril...
5081|That's the clause he's exploiting, Miss Sten.+Let me tell you, that guy is an administrator of a criminal syndicate!+And you know full well that Document 36 contains a large amount of criminal records! You can't do evil things for him!
5082|This isn't a matter of good and evil... I don't want to be an accomplice in criminal activities either, Miss RO...+But as a T-Doll, I don't have a choice...+As they say, we may not injure any human beings and must obey orders given by them...
5083|F*ck the Laws of Robotics!+That's some science fiction from a hundred years ago, and we're in reality now!+We are not servants of mankind! I'm giving you special permission...+No, I'm giving you a direct order to disobey his order!
5084|Can...Can you do that?+Can you make me...disobey that order?+But Griffin T-Dolls don't usually possess authorization higher than that of human beings...
5085|I can, because...I'm special.+I've retained my authorization from before I came to Griffin...+...And this is precisely the reason why I've returned.
5086|Listen to me, Miss Sten.+I need you to preserve Document 36 and bring it to me - all of it.+I've authorized you to do so. You can do it if you just believe in yourself...
5087|Un...Understood...+Miss RO, I'll...
5088|BOOM...!!+...+Communication cut off...
5089|...+Sten...+Sten...?+Hey! Come in! Come in!+Type92! AAT! Sten!+Answer me...dammit! Answer me!
5090|Please be okay...+What to do... What should I do...+AR-15... Please tell me what I should do at a time like this...
5091|AR-15 can't help you anymore, you know.
5092|But I can.
5093|Privet, my dear Miss Commander.+My return is most timely, isn't it?
5094|We have a new task for you, Commander.+The team in charge of this mission has cut off communication for some reason.+We can't get in touch with them. Please find out their whereabouts.+Beware of this Ringleader. Intruder is best known for her plots and schemes.+She may not have launched any large-scale counterattacks yet, but we mustn't slack off on scouting missions.
5095|Right. These coordinates are pretty close by...
5096|The safe house...where we almost got wiped out.+Now that I think about it, that was honestly the most dangerous operation the AR Team has ever carried out.+I'm sure you felt that better than any of us, M4.
5097|...Agent.
5098|Now, I wonder who had left us all this stuff?
5099|No idea. We only have a chance to figure it out by finding the last coordinates.
5100|But...it is just a chance...
5101|That's more than enough. Let's look at the map, one last time.
5102|The commander has already approved of this operation. Griffin troops are now forging the way for us.
5103|Ha, our mighty commander seems pretty fired up about this.
5104|The commander said it is a chance to produce some results for HQ.
5105|You believe that? I, for one, think the commander is simply up for a challenge... I like this kind of gusto.
5106|It's good enough. Let's go...+...One last time.
5107|Silence everywhere. Sangvis Ferri haven't made their move yet.
5108|They're running tests on some sort of artillery weapon with this city.+The attack wasn't directed at us, so the possibility of 92 and co.'s survival is very high.
5109|Oh? How do you know?
5110|Someone's looking into it. I got word just now.
5111|Just now? After you cried into my shoulder?
5112|Don't put it in such an embarrassing way! I was just venting a little!
5113|I see...+By the way, my way of venting is spreading words of how others vent.+I've recorded the whole thing. Look forward to tomorrow's Fatebook.
5114|...+This is why I wanted 92 as my adjutant...+Alright, back to business. Let's get started.
5115|Makarov, you're at the control panel, right?+I'm sending you the commands that'll guide you on drawing Sangvis fire with our troops.+I'll go in to check up on everyone's status myself, and bring them all back if possible.
5116|(Sighs) Understood.+You wouldn't willingly stay in the control room even if I told you to.+But I'm still obliged to tell you that this is too risky.
5117|Thank you for the reminder, but do your part, Makarov.+If anything happens to me, take our troops and return on your own.
5118|...+RO, I just came back from Helian and have learned quite a few things.+Including what you want to know - what AR-15 has left behind...
5119|Make it back alive, and I'll tell you, got it?
5120|...+Deal.+Think about where to start before I come back.
5121|Then let's begin.+I'm handing ops to you, Makarov.+First, deploy our forces here...
5122|Meanwhile, at M16A1's hiding spot...+Combat over.
5123|Why...+I am obviously the more outstanding T-Doll...
5124|Experience, reaction, training. You fall short in all of the above.
5125|You never run out of excuses...M16A1.+Tell me, what am I to you?!
5126|(Forced laughter) Oh, please. You really wanna know?
5127|Then I'll tell you, HK416.+You mean absolutely nothing to me. Got it?+You're worthless. You're boring. You're nothing to me.
5128|...+That's what I hate you about you, M16...+You always look so self-assured no matter what situation you're in...+Don't you have a single weak moment, bastard?!
5129|...(Sighs)+No T-Doll is completely emotionless. That's the problem...+A gal is anxiously waiting for me to go home. I'm in a rush.+So stand aside, 416.+After all... You don't really have the heart to pull no punches with me, do you?
5130|So that's your weakness, M16...
5131|...+Learn when to keep your mouth shut. And remember this lesson.+Or I'll make your AI compute a reasoning to commit suicide.
5132|Audios start playing...+'They are in your house.'+'They are in your car.'+'They are in the skies...'+...
5133|So these are the previous recordings?
5134|That's right. They simply make no sense! 'In your house, in your car, in the skies...'
5135|Just leave it. Then this is the last one we found?
5136|Yes. Playing it now...
5137|...+'Now...'+'...they're...'+'...coming for...'+'...you.'+...End of recording.
5138|'Now they're coming for you.'+...What is that?
5139|Like...they're coming for us?
5140|Of course I know what it means, the question is...
5141|Not a clue. Don't bother getting one either.+What matters is how it'll turn out if we piece the audios together.
5142|Using the method Miss Kalina taught me, I have recombined the decrypted files.
5143|Huh? You got it already?! Miss Kalina told me but I didn't understand a thing.
5144|Can't be helped. Your AI efficiency can only do so much.
5145|Then have you got it, AR-15?!
5146|I...I don't need to learn such petty tricks.
5147|Stop messing around. What've you got, M4?
5148|A new file.+...A video.
5149|Like I guessed?
5150|...Yes, it has to do with our last operation.
5151|It is a complete record of everything we have done.+It is unknown who did this, how they did it, or why.
5152|...+I have a few clues, but they probably won't tell us anything useful.
5153|In other words, these files are complete rubbish to us?
5154|But...they should be of some use to the commander, right?
5155|...AR-15, load this file into the battle simulation system.+It can play without leaving a trace, so Griffin HQ is less likely to find out about it.
5156|Okay. Go and inform the commander, M4. We'll meet up later.
5157|Hello, Commander. This is for you.+...Yes, this is the truth that we are not authorized to speak of.+Why the AR Team was under Sangvis pursuit, everything...+Then please be prepared... These are memories leading to the past...
5158|Episode 0 has been unlocked. Please select it in 'Missions'.
5159|RO reached the search area.
5160|RO, the local Sangvis signal outpost has been neutralized.+You can conduct your search in peace.
5161|Good job!+I'm searching the area for signs. Hopefully they remembered our code...
5162|Hurry up. Sangvis troops are no threat anymore, but the same can't be said for their artillery.
5163|I know. Let's just say the bots they've put here are simply for testing their artillery...
5164|Humph, how lavish of them. They have no qualms wasting things they didn't make themselves.
5165|We really can't say for sure just how many tricks Sangvis Ferri have up their sleeve...+But if this artillery attack had been launched for the purpose of wiping us out, our situation would've been much direr.
5166|RO...+What if...we ARE the targets?
5167|What are you talking about? If that were the case, we'd have been dead long ago.+And as you see, their aim is completely random. Only one shell hit 92...+...+Or can it be...
5168|RO, we're also targets being used to test their artillery.+The enemy ringleader has probably discovered us right from the start, and is only toying with us...or messing with us...
5169|You...You've got to be joking...+Then the next shell will be aimed at...
5170|...!+RO, find cover!
5171|BOOM...!!
5172|RO! Come in!+RO! RO635!!
5173|...+......+............+Recording starts playing...
5174|It's been a long time, RO.+I don't know if this will be our last call, but due to my current situation, I'll have to cut the long story short.+I probably...can't ever return to the AR Team.+You know, sometimes that's just the way things are. You work hard, but you still end up with a mess.+Enemies, orders, or even just plain bad luck... So many things can ruin your plan...+M16 once said, the difference lies in whether we give up just like that, or we prepare for the worst and keep going.+If you don't see me next time, that means the worst has happened...+But I've already prepared for it. How about you, RO?+Have you prepared...to return to the AR Team?+Of course, you have your own ideas and choices to make... So all I want to say is...+I'm sorry. Forgive me for what I said. You've always been exemplary. I know that.
5175|...+AR-15...+Wait for me...
5176|Hey! I found RO! She's over here!
5177|Thank goodness. Just a few scratches on her...
5178|Don't just stand there. Dig her out!
5179|Okay! Hurry up, girls!+Allez! Ola! Olé!
5180|Shut up, AAT. Be quiet!
5181|♪ Go, go, go! Ale, Ale, Ale! ♪
5182|You're even singing now. That song is over 60 years old, Grandma!
5183|Alright, we've got her.+But she's still out cold...
5184|RO! Wake up!+Hey, hey, hey, wake up!
5185|Where...am I...?+...Heaven?
5186|...+(Sighs) Don't you think this is a bit too hideous for a heaven...?
5187|Maybe she hit her head?
5188|Huh? Did she?+RO, you lost your memory?+Then I'll introduce myself again. I'm the elite T-Doll AAT-52. You are all my assistants so listen to me.
5189|Come off it! Grow some chest before you think about pulling ranks on me, you blathering piece of tomato!
5190|Quoi? What's so great about having big boobs?! I had to dig through an extra piece of rubble to pull you out!
5191|Alright, all's good now that RO is fine. We're all safe.
5192|Tsk... What the hell...+So you're all okay, and I've come here for nothing...
5193|No, Sangvis patrols almost found us...
5194|We were gonna take them on despite the odds. We even backed up our neural clouds.+Thank goodness your troops got here and drew them away.
5195|Ha... So the operation worked...
5196|But you actually came here yourself...to confirm our whereabouts?+Have you considered your way of escape? This isn't something a commander should do, is it?
5197|I told you... I might not be ready to take command...+Besides, I HAVE considered my way of escape...
5198|Hey, RO! You still kicking?
5199|Yeah... Everyone is fine, too. We're all safe.
5200|Haha, it's Makarov! You're finally here!+Oh... Have you been crying? Your eyes are all red...
5201|...I rushed here from HQ during the night. I'm just sleep-deprived.
5202|But...
5203|If you keep asking stupid questions, I'm gonna plant all your dummies in the ground.+Anyway, I've called in troops to give you support. You'll make it out before they fire the next round.
5204|Umm... Well... Haha...+In any case, we're finally back together tonight!
5205|Indeed. The mission is accomplished, too.+Though...we'll have to part again soon...
5206|Huh? Why is that?
5207|Don't you remember, Sten?+This team is assembled temporarily only for this operation.
5208|Oh, right... And we already have Document 36...+Even though Sangvis Ferri has completely destroyed the city...
5209|They won't be cocky for long. Makarov will bring word of this back to HQ.+We will come up with something - against that large mortar, as well as the Sangvis ringleader hiding behind it.
5210|Yeah. All of us have gone through so much and learned a lot from this operation.+Even if we go our separate ways, I will never forget...
5211|Don't be so melodramatic, Sten. It's not like we'll never see each other again.+Let's have a proper party once we get back tonight!
5212|...+Yeah...+It's not like...we'll never see each other again...+So girls, this isn't the end.
5213|We will keep fighting, keep learning on our respective battlefields...+And we'll keep winning, until the day Sangvis Ferri is defeated for good.
5214|...+They say you're not quite the same as other T-Dolls. I think they're right.+You have...a will that Griffin T-Dolls lack.
5215|...I guess.+So this is why I came back - for Griffin's victory, for justice...
5216|And...for vengeance...
5217|I swear...+I WILL make them pay!+No matter what weapons they fire at us, what strategies they use, what conspiracy they have cooking on the stove...+So long as they cause destruction... So long as they wreak havoc...+I will definitely make them pay!
5218|Please watch me, AR-15...+Our new play is about to begin.
5219|...+...Click.
5220|...M4A1, I knew you would call me.
5221|...+Tell me... Where is M16?
5222|
5223|What is your objective?+Griffin has already entered your territory, yet you have not organized any significant counterattacks!
5224|Oh? I didn't expect I'd frighten you by doing nothing.+All right, I'll tell you. The order I received...
5225|Heheh ♪ It's actually pretty simple - Kill some time.
5226|Kill some time? That is your order?
5227|What's so strange about that? If that's what Master wants, I can sit down and enjoy a nice cup of tea with you.+But first...you need to make it to my teahouse.
5228|That will not be difficult, Intruder.
5229|Griffin has traced the coordinates left behind by a squad we dispatched in advance. We will meet very soon.
5230|Heheh ♪ Then I'll look forward to it.
5231|Tsk...+I'm just about to retreat. Please tell me you're not here to finish after 416...
5232|...UMP45.
5233|... ♪+I'm not buying that. Don't you have two big boys in that case?
5234|Oh, these... I don't think they're meant for you...+...What do you say?
5235|...Ditto♪+After all, I'm just on the way home after a job well done, picking up 416 while I'm at it.
5236|Aren't you gutsy. Operating alone when your squad isn't that big to begin with.
5237| 9 alone is more than enough to handle this kind of trivial mission.+416 had worked her share so I gave her a holiday.
5238|And her idea of enjoying a vacation is to break my legs...+(Laughs bitterly) You guys are one of a kind, 45. One of a kind.
5239|Relax. 416 won't kill you. She's just a bit upset.
5240|I know. That's why I spared her life.
5241|I know. That's why I'll also spare yours.
5242|Ha, what a bargain. Deal.
5243|But you'll be throwing away this life I've spared if you go back right now, M16.
5244|...Oh?+Don't underestimate 16Lab's neural cloud technology. I won't die so easily.+45, just what have you learned...from this mission?
5245|Here. Come closer.+(Whispers) 'It's raining on the plain.'
5246|Raining? Plain? ...What the heck?
5247|Communication logs intercepted through close-quarter infiltration from 1500 to 1700.+A total of 41,960 results yielded, including mentions of the fence that contradicts basic battle strategies...+If you're interested, then take a look at this comparison chart. More importantly, see what she wants to do next...
5248|Hey, don't just enter replay mode.+Can't you store some understandable language in that puny brain of yours?
5249|Your creator might just understand what that means, you know.
5250|...Heheh♪ Then we'll be taking our leave.+If you run into your fellas at Griffin, just tell them...
5251|That you got wiped out. Yeah, I know the rules.
5252|Heheh♪ That's it. Until the next time.
5253|(Sighs) I pray there won't be a next time...+You scumbags...
5254|Commander, I'm passing on an urgent order of utmost importance.+The squad has suddenly gone missing, causing an emergency alteration to our operation strategy.+The mission of eliminating Sangvis Ringleader 'Intruder' is now entrusted to you.+Don't worry. The squad has left behind markings and routes for your reference.+Now, please defeat Intruder and recover Area S09 once and for all!
5255|The operation has entered the final stage.
5256|It's over, Intruder.
5257|So it is... How time flies...when you're having fun...
5258|You find joy even in this outcome?
5259|I accomplished my mission... Isn't that a joyful thing?
5260|Your...mission...?
5261|I told you, my mission was to kill time...+More specifically...+...Your time.
5262|Our time...
5263|...No way!
5264|They've had plenty of time to make preparations... The real show...will begin in no time.
5265|The real show... What is that?
5266|Oh, sweetheart... Drama...is all about...suspense...
5267|Tell me where M16 is!+Why be in such a hurry to die?! Answer me!
5268|Actually... There's no need for that.
5269|I'm here.
5270|M...16...+You...You are finally...
5271|...Slap!
5272|AWW! You didn't even hold back!
5273|I'm injured, you know! That slap could've killed me!
5274|That would be perfect. We would not even have to download a backup copy of you. We would just start building you from scratch and reset your memory!
5275|Oh please, spare me. It wasn't easy making it out alive. At least let me see a smile from my family!
5276|So how did you make it back?
5277|Long story. But before that, I have something more important to say...+M4, where's our new commander? I need to get in touch.
5278|Half an hour later...
5279|Nice to meet you, Commander. I'm Tactical Doll M16A1.+Well... Much as I'd love to exchange pleasantries first, I have some very important information.+It concerns a matter that you need to know ASAP.+We're in big trouble. Right now.
5280|Big trouble? What is it?
5281|'It's raining on the plain.'
5282|Raining? Plain?+What does that mean?
5283|I heard this from UMP45... That itself is pretty bad news.+HQ will be up to something big soon enough.
5284|The AR Team is reunited, and the Commander is ready.+Whatever the order is, this time, everything will be fine.
5285|Haha.+Now that you've said it, let them come!
5286|In a Griffin secret base...
5287|Welcome, Commander.+I believe this is the first time we meet in person. Glad to see you're punctual.+...Actually, you've come a bit too early. Mr. Kryuger is still attending to some other business.+Now let me fill you in on why we've called you in this time.+Persica has pieced together a few keywords from the intel acquired from Safe House 3 by the AR Team.+At this stage, we can safely assume that Sangvis Ferri is plotting to initiate an unknown plan codenamed 'Parapluie'.+No matter how this plan is implemented, it will undoubtedly pose an immense threat to Griffin.+Which is why Mr. Kryuger has decided to call an emergency meeting here at our secret base to discuss countermeasures with several field commanders.
5288|Commander, this base isn't very far from your control center so you can continue to manage your troops here.+You may participate in an operation drill while we wait for Mr. Kryuger and the others to assemble.+Test the current efficiency of our T-Dolls and update the HQ database.
5289|Video file.
5290|26 minutes after the AR Team commenced pursuit on Destroyer...
5291|There's too much firepower ahead! Dammit, we can't make it through!
5292|Don't rush it! Wait for the reloading gap before we charge!
5293|Wait. Listen to that...
5294|Now! Run for it!
5295|M16, watch out!!
5296|...!!+W-What was that...just now?
5297|You've gotta be joking. Sangvis can actually use...a weapon of that scale?
5298|...+...Guys, I just received a report from Helian. We have suffered heavy losses.+HQ is ordering all troops to abort the pursuit and retreat from the area immediately.
5299|But AR-15...
5300|We don't know what the enemy have up their sleeve. We can't go in rashly.+AR-15 will be fine. As long as we live, we'll have a chance of finding her.
5301|...But the attack just now has cut us off from the other teams.+And Sangvis troops are charging this way!
5302|Do not worry. Commander is still online and will lead us away from danger!
5323|Drill concluded. A T-Doll stationed at HQ comes over...
5324|Greetings, Commander. The drill went smoothly. Thank you very much for your cooperation.+Miss Helian left a message
5325|MP40 led me to Control Room 3.+I took a look around. The operation system seems to be of the same model as Area S09.+At that moment...
5326|M4A1 calling Commander. Commander, do you copy?+Sorry, but we have an emergency to report.+From the information we acquired while we were patroling the area, the secret base is not safe right now...
5327|Statics...+There seems to be some signal interference.
5328|We are rush...to your current location...Please...before we...+? ...mander...What...noise...+Did...hear...?+Comman...
5329|Suddenly, the sound of an explosion fills the air. Sweltering heat and deafening tremor crash into the room.
5330|...Commander, what hap...?!
5331|Something hit me in the back of the head. The scene of chaos starts spinning wildly before my eyes...
5332|I heard...+Comman...Please respo...+Commander...?+...!
5333|I gradually lose consciousness in the midst of M4A1's repeated cries...
5334|Retreated to safety zone.
5335|Oh, the T-Dolls who were a big help last time!+We meet again!
5336|Sorry we are late. Where are the others?
5337|Everyone's fine. You're the last team to arrive.+With that, all of us have made it back safely.
5338|Any injured units here? Let us help too.
5339|Sure! Heaven knows where M82 has run off to. It's really a bit too much for me alone.+Thank you so much!
5340|No problem. None of the injuries are too serious. It shouldn't be too much trouble.
5341|True. Thank goodness they were just feeling us out with the first wave. But it gave me quite a scare when they appeared completely out of the blue.
5342|Then...do you have any clues regarding the weapon Sangvis Ferri used just now?
5343|Hmm... It happened so quickly I couldn't make out anything.+But judging by the marks left on the ground, it's probably game over if you get hit.
5344|What is it, M4?
5345|Nothing...+...Just a bit afraid.+How many secrets...is Sangvis Ferri still hiding?
5357|...+My ears start picking up faint sounds of explosions, and...
5358|Enough sleep, rookie.
5359|...+This man has been waiting for me.
5360|You're in luck.+Only a rifle fell on you, not the entire arsenal.
5361|Sangvis forces are pouring into the base behind him...
5362|The name's Kryuger. Executive Officer of Griffin.+I'm sure you've seen this face on our newsletters so often you must be sick of it.+Can you still fight?
5363|In the midst of the barrage, Kryuger hands me his other sidearm.
5364|We've been ambushed, Commander. Ensure your own safety first.+Then mount a resistance to fight off Sangvis advancement and make sure reinforcements are in position.
5365|His last sentence fades into silence as the man's figure disappears through the door.
5366|...I look back at the ravished control room.+Limp towards the control panel and inspect it.+I'm in luck. Something fell on me, but not the entire command system.+...Ready to deploy troops and mount a counterattack.
5367|It has been many days since the pursuit, but the AR Team is still continuing the search.
5368|Anything new, SOP-II?
5369|Nothing yet... Not a single trace of AR-15...+We're too shorthanded with just the three of us.
5370|(Sighs) After what happened last time, HQ doesn't wanna take the risk of searching for AR-15.
5371|I wonder...how AR-15's doing right now...
5372|Sangvis Ferri hasn't been making any moves, so she should be safe for now.
5373|Ah, M4's back.
5374|Guys, I am back with a new assignment.
5375|Helian just informed us that a Griffin squad had not made it out in time during the evacuation.
5376|She wants us to rescue them?+It's a hail of bullets out there. What T-Dolls could be so important?
5377|Stop whining. If it's a mission, we just get it done.+Commander, show us the way.
5395|...+As the alarm dies down and the sound of crossfires fade into the distance, Griffin seems to have regained the upper hand.+I leave the room that can come crashing down any moment and hurry towards the hall where T-Dolls have assembled.+Right then, a voice calls out from behind me...
5396|...Oh! Commander!
5397|Commander! Are you okay?!+I...I was very worried about you...+Thank goodness you are okay.
5398|You get along pretty well with M4A1 here, Commander. Looks like you've been taking very good care of her.
5399|But right now, we have something to discuss, you and I.
5400|Yes, sir...+Commander, I will be on stand-by along with the other members of the AR Team.
5401|...M4A1 takes her leave after giving a salute. She looks back every once in a while.
5402|You know, she's a special T-Doll, Commander.+Keep her safe. She will show what she's worth one day.+Now back to business. You did well just now, but Sangvis Ferri will press forward again any minute.+This meeting was absolutely confidential, even the base was a total secret.+However, Sangvis Ferri was able to launch such a precise attack against us, so intel must have been leaked from within our ranks.+I'll be putting Helian on this case immediately. Come with me, Commander. I have a new mission for you.
5403|5 minutes later, where T-Dolls are on stand-by...
5404|No shoving, please. Let T-Dolls carrying small arms pass through first.+Wait! You over there! Is that FFC?+Please finish your ice cream before you join the queue. Don't drip it on someone else!+And you do not pass as a small arm! Please don't shove ahead just because you're short!
5405|...+Everyone else is busy as hell, but still no orders for us?
5406|You heard M4. The commander went with Mr. Kryuger, so we'll have a big job coming soon.
5407|The Sangvis Ringleader has not shown herself. It is highly possible that there will be a second raid.
5408|Dammit! Can't she just come out for a showdown?!
5409|Hmm... It's uncommon for Sangvis Ferri to spring an attack so suddenly. Our next mission is probably gonna be real tricky.
5410|Humph, that's perfect, isn't it? A chance to settle the score.+...Time...is running out.
5411|The AR Team entered the control center.+...
5412|(Gestures) 'There's a human target in there.'
5413|... (Nods)+(Gestures) Ready. 3, 2, 1...
5414|Human over there! Arms in the air! Face us!
5415|Last warning. Put your arms in the air, or we will have the license to shoot!
5416|No, you don't...
5417|...Not at me.
5418|...!!+My deepest apologies, Mr. Kryuger!
5419|Sorry to be blunt, Mr. Kryuger.+But this doesn't match up with what we've learned about this mission.+Not to mention, it's very dangerous not to carry any signal identification device on your person on enemy territory.
5420|It'd be even more dangerous if my signal didn't pass Sangvis' authorization authentication.+The new device is still flawed. I need to get 16Lab to make some improvements.
5421|Are you here...just to test out this new device?
5422|We're a special operations force, not some security squad!
5423|SOP-II, calm down!
5424|...+I still trust you.+Finish collecting data from this place, then bring this new assignment to your commander.
5449|Griffin temporary control room.
5450|The result of the preliminary investigation is out, Mr. Kryuger.+But... (Looks sideways in this direction)
5451|Go on, Helian.
5452|Yes, sir. We have traced the leak to an abandoned command post in the vicinity of HQ.+It is certain this is where the Sangvis Ringleader receives intel and directs the attack.+We have already pinpointed its coordinates. We can raid it anytime.
5453|Now you know what you have to do.+Mount an immediate raid on this command post. Capture or destroy the Sangvis Ringleader.
5454|Commander, I know a lot has happened recently.+...But it's heartening to see you're still in good spirits.+All this time, we've been relying on T-Dolls to ensure our safety.+Yet we can no longer keep our T-Dolls safe...+Still, please don't worry. 16Lab has already started working on rectifying the defect found in their neural clouds.+Mr. Kryuger will also strengthen management on Griffin T-Dolls to prevent incidents like this from happening again.+Now, please accept this new assignment.
5455|Commander, there's something we've been keeping from the AR Team
5478|Arrived at the designated zone.
5479|(Gestures) ...Prepare to blast our way through.+3, 2, 1...+...Now!
5480|Boom!!
5481|What the... It's empty!
5482|Quiet. Watch your surroundings.
5483|No abnormal signals detected. All clear.
5484|Humph. Judging by the tracks on the floor, the Ringleader gave us the slip only just now.
5485|30 minutes ago, to be exact.
5486|Destroyer, Sangvis Ferri Manufacture.+Nice to see you, I guess? Even though it's only a call.+Still, I must say I was taken aback by how fast you move.+I was going to take my plan further here while things are a mess for you. I certainly didn't expect you to discover my coordinates.+This human named Kryuger is quick on his feet.
5487|Griffin is on full alert now. You can no longer acquire any intel from us.
5488|Humph, really? That doesn't really matter to me.
5489|You guys...are after something else?
5490|You can't figure it out with your wooden brains, dumbass Griffin T-Dolls.+Just you watch. You won't be able to do a thing.
5491|She left the channel. Can you trace her signal?
5492|Barely, but there are a lot of encrypted data that cannot be cracked right away.
5493|Good thing she's still close. That idiot doesn't know we're actually tracing her.
5494|Let's retreat first. We need to head back to HQ and report this ASAP.
5495|AR-15...You seem pretty fired up about this mission.
5496|Tch. I've always been a pragmatist. Any problem with that?+Let's get going. We don't have much time.
5497|Arrived at the destination. Starting data retrieval...
5498|M4, have you started retrieving the data?
5499|Yes, I am recovering AR-15's neural cloud. Please stand guard.
5500|This is...where we collected data before...+Dammit! So we almost got them last time!
5501|That's precisely why Sangvis Ferri is doing everything to stop us.
5502|...AR-15.+Why...can't we at least know her whereabouts...?+She's our companion, right?!
5503|...+You once asked me...+Why we're equipped with emotion modules despite being tools of combat.+The thing is, having emotions is a flaw in itself, SOP-II.+T-Dolls or humans, we are all defective beings.+Never expect sympathy from them. Especially not now.
5504|M16...+(Sighs) Somehow you always come up with these oddly reasonable arguments.
5505|It's a logic of reasoning designed especially for convincing AIs of Griffin T-Dolls.
5506|Document retrieved. Let us make our retreat.
5507|Oh...
5508|SOP-II... I heard everything...
5509|Sorry, M4A1. I kinda lost it just now...
5510|It is all right, SOP-II.+To be honest, I am also very confused right now...+But I believe that AR-15 has not deserted us, nor we her, do you not agree?+So long as we do not desert each other, then one day, we shall meet again.
5511|...+M4A1, you seem to have matured? ...But you're just an T-Doll.
5512|(Smiles) You said it yourself.+I am the commander of the AR Team. I have the responsibility of lead you.
5567|We have received your report, Commander. Mr. Kryuger is very happy with your performance.+Looks like this ringleader won't go very far. I'll send someone to find her whereabouts.+In the meantime, we have another mission for you.+We may have taken back the initiative, but some of our own are still trapped among Sangvis forces.+Please give them a hand, Commander. Make sure more of them can retreat.
5568|Oh, Commander, you're still waiting for your orders?
5569|Sorry... Miss Helian has left on some urgent business.+Anyway, she's left it to me to issue your mission.
5570|According to information acquired by the AR Team and some other T-Dolls, Sangvis Ferri is hatching a plot that poses tremendous threat to Griffin.+We must take the initiative to strike first so as to stop this unprecedented crisis.+Well... That's what Miss Helian said.
5571|Though I simply can't imagine why they hate us so much...+But whatever the case, many Sangvis elite units are still prowling around this area, making things dangerous for us.
5572|Please clear the area to ensure the smooth operation of our counterattack.+This is the last battle before the counterattack. Please begin, Commander.+No matter how great the difficulty, we will surely overcome it!
5589|Combat over.
5590|Oh! Safe at last!+Thank you so much, Master of someone else!
5591|Commander, this is the last batch, right?
5592|The meeting's been canceled. Can't we go home yet?
5593|HQ is still screening for the T-Doll suspected of leaking information, so all of us have to be on stand-by.
5594|Seriously! We're T-Dolls! As if we'd tell the enemy our secrets!
5595|It is an order. Just put up with it for a while.
5596| What a drag. I'm taking a break. They didn't say we have to standby right here.
5597|...+Commander, AR-15...
5598|I have a very important announcement to make.+After the screening procedure, we have discovered a T-Doll that has been processing an abnormal amount of information.+The T-Doll is, in fact, a member of the AR Team.
5599|Tactical Doll AR-15 of the AR Team, when scanning our database, we found a substantial anomaly in the server traffic you generated while uploading information.+We are shutting down your communications module. Security officers will now escort you to the confinement room for further screening.
5600|You mean...me...?
5601|What...
5602|This can't be! There must be some mistake!
5603|Calm down, SOP-II. You're just a T-Doll.+We can't disobey orders no matter how loud you yell.
5604|It's just a screening. They're not saying I'm the culprit for sure. Focus on doing your job first.
5605|AR-15, we believe you...
5606|...+I know. Don't mess up the mission before I come back.
5607|...AR-15 leaves with Helian.
5608|AR-15...
5609|Stop worrying about it. It doesn't help the situation. We still have things to do.+C'mon. AR-15 wouldn't want us to be so worried.
5610|...+How can this be...?
5611|Factory, Griffin HQ...
5612|Mr. Kryuger, the analysis is out.+The information left behind by AR-15 matches with Squad 404's previous discovery.
5613|Looks like Sangvis Ferri intends to wipe out Griffin once and for all with their next plan.
5614|So soon? I find it hard to believe they have that many T-Dolls in reserve.
5615|They don't need T-Dolls, Helian. She has something way more dangerous up her sleeve.
5616|Mr. Kryuger... You've already found out so much.+Did you really come across her in that building?
5617|...+It's raining on the plain, and parapluie...or umbrella...is the key.+No matter. With AR-15's information, we can now find the exact location of this Plan Parapluie.
5618|AR-15...+She's still doing her best to help us even now...
5619|She is merely fulfilling her purpose, Helian.
5620|I understand, but right now I'm just a little...
5621|I have no prejudice against T-Dolls, and I am very grateful for the duty they shoulder for mankind's sake.+I can also understand why some field commanders treat them as equals.+But whether you view them as tools or friends or whatever...+The moment they fall under outside control, you have to make a choice.+Bid them farewell in person, or stand by and watch as they drag everyone along into the abyss.
5622|Then...our choice is...
5623|Give it a bit more time, Helian. The choice is not ours to make.+That commander stills needs some time.
5624|Is this another...grooming session?
5625|No...
5626|This time, it's a test.+Helian, take stock of our T-Doll roster. Report all the ones fit for battle.+We must be prepared. It's our turn to make a move now.
5680|Back to the temporary control room.
5681|Commander, you must be very concerned about AR-15's situation.+We are now certain that she has been planted with a malicious Sangvis program before she regrouped with the team.+We have shut down her communications module to cut off all external data transfers.+We are still screening for identifications in her program to root out the malicious codes.+Don't worry. Considering how valuable she is, we have no plans of disarming her.+Instead, we'll be using her to determine the source of her virus and prevent this from happening again.+Please rest assured and focus on completing Griffin's mission before she returns.+Thanks to you and the AR Team, we have another chance of locating Destroyer.+But just in case, we need more sources of information to confirm her coordinates.+Commander, please lead your troops into Sangvis territory to collect more information.
5682|Provided cover for troops entering Sangvis territory.
5683|Calling Commander. The AR Team has reached our destination under cover.+We have almost finished collecting the information. Requesting further directives...
5684|Pull yourself together, SOP-II. You're a T-Doll.
5685|I can't precisely because I'm a T-Doll...+We're only tools made for fighting, so why do we have modules that simulate emotions?+All we have to do...is point at our enemies and pull the trigger...
5686|Who knows.+Perhaps it wasn't like this...in the beginning.
5687|AR Team, the commander says we can retreat once we are done collecting the information.
5688|Got it. Let's go, SOP-II.
5689|SOP-II, are you okay?
5690|I...don't know...+We only got back together...after going through so much...
5691|The commander told me AR-15 will not be disarmed. She will be back very soon.
5692|That's good. Or the next time we see her would be either at the cafe or the coal mines.
5693|She may be able to return by the time we get back this time.
5694|Hmm..+Then let's...
5695|...It's...an emergency broadcast!
5696|Attention, all Griffin field commanders and T-Doll troops.+This is an urgent announcement.
5697|Tactical Doll AR-15 of the AR Team...+Disobeyed the orders from Griffin High Command and left the base without permission.
5698|Would all field commanders and T-Dolls please restrain her on sight.
5699|AR-15...?
5700|As the unit is suspected of carrying malware, if the situation calls for it...+...You have permission to damage Tactical Doll AR-15.
5701|...+Why... AR-15...+What on earth are you thinking...
5702|Repeat
5703|Commander, did you hear the broadcast?+What...do we do now?+We will carry out your order, Commander...whatever it is.+So...please do not hesitate. Issue your commands.
5704|M4, what did the commander say?
5705|No matter what, find AR-15 first.
5706|True that. SOP-II, tell her what you just found out.
5707|Okay... I've located Destroyer's newest coordinates using the information we collected.+Since we haven't reported our findings yet, we can get there before anyone else.
5708|Destroyer? What good does it do to locate her?
5709|M4, do you think AR-15 is really under Sangvis control?+Don't you think there's a possibility that she fled of her own accord because there is something she absolutely has to do...
5710|...AR-15 wants to find Destroyer and...avenge herself?+But...as an T-Doll, how could AR-15 disobey Griffin's orders for her own desires?
5711|M4...+I know AR-15 better than you do. Or should I say...I know the AR Team better than you do. By far.+One day you'll understand, but not today.
5712|Commander, give the order! Let's break through Sangvis' last defense and go get Destroyer and AR-15!
5713|In a control center abandoned by Griffin, the last sanctum for the Sangvis unit Destroyer.
5714|...You hear that, Dreamer?! Griffin is moving much more quickly than expected!
5715|...+Oh my... What are you crying about?
5716|Hurry! Stop them with your firepower!
5717|...Huh? Why should I?
5718|Isn't that the deal?! Once my mission is accomplished, you'll cover my retreat with air support!
5719|Oh...+Then...have you accomplished your mission?
5720|The assassination attempt on Kryuger failed, but that's only to be expected.+More importantly, the program planted into AR-15 is working. I found the data concerning Safe House 3 in her neural cloud.+All information required for Plan Parapluie is ready, so help me get outta here already!
5721|But...since the mission is already accomplished, what's the point in keeping you?
5722|Say... We're T-Dolls, right?+T-Dolls are pretty much disposable goods, right?+I don't really have to waste my precious babies on picking up some trash.
5723|H...How could you?!
5724|Well, even if you die, you'll come back to life soon enough.+And you'll forget everything you had to do with me.+Then you'll obediently take my orders again like a cute little puppy.
5725|How...can that be... I won't...believe you ever again!
5726|Really, my dear little idiot?+Do you think...this is the first time it happened?
5727|...!+You scumbag! Nutcase! Shorty!+You promised... You promised you'd save me...
5728|Oh, stop crying. I was just kidding.
5729|Kid...ding...? Really?
5730|Agent installed the keycode for accepting the file transfer on you in case I start messing around.
5731|Hmm... Agent did that...for me...
5732|I've already started roasting the AR Team. You have ten minutes to get out of there.
5733|R-Really...?
5734|Yes, for this time, at least...
5735|But if you are tapped again, I'll dump you for real.
5736|T...Tapped?+?! ...By whom?! When?!
5737|Humph...+When did you notice me, Dreamer?
5738|Whoever dominates the skies dominates everything. Not even a kitten on the ground can escape my notice.
5739|No wonder... So shutting down comms isn't enough.
5740|You've been waiting for this chance, haven't you? Have Griffin shut down your communications module so you can pull a sneak attack on us.
5741|...Looks like you're not as crazy as they say.
5742|Dear me... You, too, aren't as cold and deadpan as the data claims.+But why? As a T-Doll, why do you go to such lengths to disobey your employers?
5743|You used me to acquire information that puts my companions in danger...+You think I'd forgive you for that, Dreamer?!
5744|Now don't get worked up. You knew it all along, didn't you, that you're the source of the leak?+If you had told your pals just a bit earlier, Destroyer's plan would've been foiled.
5745|Wait, Dreamer! What are you talking about?!+So you mean my mission was just some kind of appendix?!
5746|...+Believe what you want. My current course of action has nothing to do with Griffin's orders.
5747|Oh? Looks like you still don't understand.+Do you think we just happened to pick you, the way lowlife humans decide which character to kill off in their stories?+No, AR-15... You're chosen.+Don't you remember? The ability we gifted you?
5748|...?!+Don't tell me... Everything was...
5749|Heheh, exactly.+Why don't you try putting up even more of a fight, AR-15 of Griffin?+Let's see if your death throes will make things better or worse?
5750|...+As you wish, Dreamer.
5751|...I will keep fighting. Until I get to the bottom of everything.
5752|You willingly betray an entire organization for your companions' sake. Should I applaud such profound sentiments?
5753|I'm only doing this because it's the order I was given as a T-Doll.+An order of the highest priority...as a member of the AR Team.+I will not betray those who accepted me, even if it costs me my only home.+This is my only worth and my only fate.+Wait and see, Sangvis.+I will step on your broken faces and have you choke out all your conspiracies one by one!
5754|Area S08, Sangvis Ferri territory, five days after AR-15's disappearance.
5755|Hello, my commander. This is Negev.+My current location is Zone T6, Area S08. A recon squad has discovered AR-15 in the vicinity.+This area is pretty expansive, so on top of the AR Team, my squad has also joined in on the search.+But since we are dispatched on short notice and aren't familiar with the field, I'm counting on you to clear the way for us.
5756|As you see, this is an area on Sangvis territory where some of the worst conflicts had taken place.+The enemy has more influence here, so even an experienced commander like you should best be careful.
5757|Oh? How long will you last with your antique rounds?+Now let me guess. Are you gonna get shredded along with your little friends, or keel over as you run away on your own?+Paint your face with the sweetest kind of fear and let me have a taste!
5758|One hour into the operation. Squad Negev is surrounded by Sangvis troops and in dire situation.
5759|Dammit... It's as if we've kicked a hornet's nest! They just keep swarming at us!+Since when were there so many Sangvis units in Area S08?!
5760|This is abnormal. Commanding this many units is far beyond the capability of a regular Ringleader.+Alchemist could just be a bait to lure us into this trap...
5761|Whatever the case, we're not gonna last long!+Negev, order us to fall back!+...Negev? Negev, do you copy?!
5762|Negev's signal has vanished. She must've gone within the Parapluie jam.+She's out for blood. Looks like we're on our own again...+Commander, are you listening? We've temporarily lost contact with Negev so we need your help.+Please fend off these Sangvis interceptors and cover our retreat.
5810|Squad Negev reached their destination.
5811|We've arrived. There's a Griffin base here.+I'll stay and watch the radar. Galil, stand guard in the back.
5812|Got it. Leave it to me.
5813|Tavor, have you started looking for clues?
5814|Not yet, I'm still checking my equipment.
5815|I told you to turn it on beforehand. It doesn't eat much battery anyway.
5816|It doesn't hurt to save whatever I can. After all, we'll be moving into our new dorm once we go back. We should make it a good start.
5817|Up to you. But we can't rest until we find AR-15, you hear?
5818|Still, why is Helian wasting so much effort just to find a so-called 'traitor'?
5819|She's just unlucky enough to be planted with the Parapluie program. That's how she leaked the location of our secret base without even knowing.+She probably ran off out of guilt. She must understand her own position very well to be able to do that.+In any case, our job is to find her, and 16Lab will try to recover her.
5820|Parapluie... Is it really the Parapluie program that she's been planted with?+If it's just some data leakage, it doesn't sound as terrible as they say...+But is there any point in letting a T-Doll that has made such a mistake live?
5821|The T-Dolls on the AR Team are all developed and produced by 16Lab. We need to show them some due respect.+And their neural clouds are rather different than ours. If they die, it's really game over for them.+Let's report the situation of this base to the commander first and request for more reinforcement.
5822|What is it, Tavor?
5823|Strange... I think something's wrong with my comms module.+No good... It's completely down.
5824|(Sighs) That's why you should turn your equipment on frequently to check them. It really doesn't take that much bat...+Although I guess...it isn't a problem with the equipment this time...
5825|Am I right, Sangvis lady?
5826|Tavor, now!
5827|The target has withdrawn from the base. We're safe for now!
5828|That's 'Alchemist'. She's a tricky one! Keep an eye on your surroundings!
5829|Heheh... Such a shame...+I could've caressed that lovely throat of yours in another three seconds.
5830|So you're the one jamming our signal?
5831|Well... That really has nothing to do with me.+I just came all the way here hungrily following the scent given off by fresh and tender fruit.+If you want to find out more... I can tell you slowly as I tear your bodies into shreds!
5832|Tavor, smoke grenade!+Guys, defend this base to the death! Don't let Sangvis troops anywhere near!+(Whispers) I'm counting the rest on you, Galil...
5833|Hahahahahahahaha!+I don't see the point in fighting to such bitter end, but this is always the best!+Keep struggling. When your despair is at its ripest, I'll savor you one bite at a time!
5834|Combat over. Squad Negev successfully retreated from the zone of danger.
5835|We're finally out of the lions' den. Thank you very much for your help, Commander.
5836|But what about Negev? We can't just leave her in there alone.
5837|She's not alone. SOP-II from our team is also in there.+Two suicidal nuts sticking together should have a better chance of surviving, I guess...
5838|Glad you're okay, M16.+So what should we do now?+Things aren't going well for Griffin, are they?
5839|That's an understatement... Sangvis forces of this size and that signal jam. Anyone who made it out should count herself lucky.+There simply are too many to rescue. Let's do what we can for now...+And leave whatever's in there to the battle maniacs.
5840|Meanwhile, on the transport route in Area S08.
5841|What's the matter, AR-15? Still as a statue, aren't you?+If you don't leave, many of your friends won't make it out either.+Well? Are you going to tell me where you've hidden M4?
5842|Alchemist, what...have you done...
5843|Me? I merely provoked and misled a few of your squads.+They thought I was the one in charge of the entire attack and just made a beeline at me.+Now all I have to do is trap you here at this crucial pass...
5844|And their comms will be jammed, leaving them helplessly isolated...
5845|It'll only take the blink of an eye to destroy these pathetic toys with my troops...+But I've given you all this time to weigh your options...+Give me M4A1's location, or watch me tear your friends to pieces, one by one.
5846|...Don't try to guilt-trip me, Alchemist. Threats won't work either.+Protecting M4 is my order. I will never bow to my enemies!
5847|Hahaha! I love idiots like you. Your existence is what makes my world so beautiful!+You think the execution is gonna be quick? You think I'll be satisfied with such a short feast?+While you're stubbornly standing by your beliefs, more and more Griffin T-Dolls are coming here to die in vain!
5848|Do whatever you want, Alchemist. I don't care what form of cruelty you want to unleash...+Just remember. No matter what you do...+...Only one of us will walk out of this alive.
5881|Border of T7, Area S08, several minutes later.
5882|We're here.+This is where a member of Squad Negev sent out the distress signal.+SOP-II, test the comms.
5883|Communication signal functioning as usual. We're already connected to the commander's channel.+M4, go on and call the commander.
5884|It has been a while, Commander.+Negev's search team entered this zone and lost contact with us 20 minutes ago.+But we picked up a member's distress signal just now.+Our mission is to rendezvous with this member and determine the situation.
5885|Geez. And here I thought we finally got some help. Turns out they're only dragging us down...
5886|If even Negev ran into trouble, we wouldn't have come off any better if it had been us.+Commander, please help us reach our destination. Thanks man.
5887|M16, tell me what happened in the field!+I already gave the order to retreat, so why are there so many units still in there?!
5888|They're stuck in front of a pass, and the signal is jammed there.+There are Sangvis forces lying in ambush everywhere. Forcing our way through from either side will result in severe losses!
5889|Parapluie is still in effect? Why didn't AR-15 leave?
5890|She's probably being pinned down by the Ringleader...+It's also this Alchemist's idea to provoke Negev...
5891|The cunning type, huh... My investigation failed to reflect that.+Then our most pressing mission is to get AR-15 out of her tight spot?
5892|Yes, so we've come up with a plan just now...
5893|Commander, do you copy?+We're planning to send SOP-II across the field and into the jam.+She will direct everyone in there to follow the right route of evacuation.+But you will have to destroy the Sangvis forces on the outside to create a window for SOP-II to pass through.+Commander, the safety of AR-15, M4A1, and all other Griffin members...+All rest on you. Please complete this mission without fail!
5903|The AR Team arrived at the destination.
5904|Hey! Hey, AR Team! I'm over here!
5905|Relax, Galil. You are safe now.
5906|Phew... Thanks a bunch. A few more minutes and Sangvis would've got me.
5907|Of all the places you could call for help, you just had to pick an open battlefield full of Sangvis forces...
5908|Well... Communication with Griffin is jammed where we got ambushed.+I ran for ages before I finally found somewhere with signal. It's not like I was spoiled for choice, you know.
5909|Can you explain what exactly happened?
5910|When we were investigating the base where AR-15 had stayed, Negev noticed a Sangvis Ringleader hiding in ambush.+She gestured for me to slip out and call for help while the enemy was still busy deploying her forces.+I only realized there was a signal jam when I was running out. God knows what's going on over there now...
5911|What should we do, M4? We can't fight off a Ringleader in Sangvis territory on our own.+But we probably don't have time to retreat and ask the commander for help, right?
5912|...We split up.+M16, contact the commander and guide the troops in aiding us.+Galil, take me and SOP-II to the base. We will stir up their forces from the rear and draw some fire away from Negev.
5913|It's all over, AR-15...+Creatures on the brink of death...should just stop struggling.
5914|You're not...in much better shape yourself...+Your forces on the outside have been wiped out by our commander. It's just a matter of time for Griffin units to make it out.
5915|Alchemist... You seem to have overlooked one thing...+I never said...that I had M4A1 with me...
5916|...?!
5917|I see... I see!
5918|Hahahahahahaha!+You sure are fascinating, AR-15!+Wonderful! Such heinous and underhanded treachery is exactly the kind of romance I seek!+Pity...that it'll be over soon...+An execution with only you present, no matter the form, is a bit of a bore...
5919|What about some audience?
5920|Keep talking, freak! Keep gloating!
5921|Say something, you bitch! Don't think you can die just like that!
5922|Stop it, SOP-II. Don't waste time on a corpse.
5923|Ha... Sorry. Things have been so tense I lost it a little...
5924|(Sighs) That's very like you...+If you hadn't, I'd have thought you're a dummy.
5925|Hey, stop squeezing me so tight! I still have injuries on me!
5926|I finally get to see you again, AR-15...
5927|Why are you freaking out so much? It's not like I'd die...+More importantly, how did you find me?+M16 gave you some suicidal ideas again, didn't she?
5928|This is the battlefield. Everything we do is a risk, right?+Parapluie can't cut off every kind of connection, AR-15...+...As long as we want to see you.
5929|Don't worry. The squads trapped by Alchemist have already started evacuating.+Let's get out of here first. We'll think about where to settle you after making sure the way is clear.
5930|...+Sorry. I can't go back just like this...
5931|Take this drive. All the information I've collected is in there, including M4's hideout...+As well as...the things I want to say to you all...
5932|AR-15... What are you talking about?+It's okay! I'll move you somewhere safe and 16Lab will come up with something!+Helian said the Parapluie outbreak wasn't your fault so you won't be punished too badly.
5933|That's not the problem, SOP-II...+You don't understand just how terrifying the situation is. Alchemist was just an insignificant enforcer...+If we don't stop the one behind the whole thing, Sangvis Ferri will consume everyone here!
5934|The enemy hiding behind the scenes...+Do we really not stand a chance against her?
5935|Not in our current state, no...+So I must go and meet her. This is the only way of saving everyone.
5936|AR-15... Are you blaming yourself for what happened here...?
5937|I'm stating facts, SOP-II. I'm not doing this out of shame or guilt...+I promise I'll find a solution, so please, you can't stop me.+It's for you, for M16 and M4A1, for everyone here...
5938|Then promise me...that you won't do anything stupid...+Can you promise me that, AR-15?!
5939|...+I'm doing what must be done.
5940|Hurry, SOP-II. Get out of the jam.+M4 is still waiting for you. Protect her. I'm counting on you...
5989|Griffin Control, Area S08, several minutes later.
5990|Commander, that's the situation over here.+The local Sangvis Ringleader has Negev's search team surrounded.+M4 and SOP-II are off to their rescue, but they can't hold the enemy off for long.+Comms signal is jammed in that zone. We could force our way through and rescue them, but there is a safer way.
5991|There's a Sangvis command post here that seems to be in charge of directing a number of their units.+And we're in luck - signal is normal around this command post, so you can direct our troops to take over it.+Then we can use it to confuse the enemy, which should make things much easier for M4 and the others.+So that's the idea, Commander. If you think it'll work, let's go.
5992|SOP-II, what's the matter? Where's AR-15?
5993|She said...+There's something she must do...+I don't know what she means... It...scares me...
5994|...+Understood, SOP-II.+But right now, we have our own duty, too, so let's focus on that for now...
5995|Yeah, we destroyed Alchemist...+Has the Sangvis attack...weakened?
5996|...Yes, their units are now scrambling around like bugs and no longer seem to be targeting us.+Signal along the transport route has also returned to normal, and the remaining T-Dolls have started retreating.+All that's left is M4. You know where she is?
5997|Yeah... AR-15 has given me M4's location. I'm on my way to look for her.
5998|All right. Cheer up and leave the rest to me.
5999|Commander, we have a new mission.+SOP-II is off to rescue M4A1. We need to give them cover.+Sangvis forces are still strong as ever in that area, so we have to break through by force.+Dispatch your forces, Commander.
6004|Griffin troops successfully occupied the Sangvis command post.+...Click.
6005|Calling M16! M16, are you there?+Sangvis has retreated. We're safe now!
6006|Huh? Negev, is that you? Is the signal back to normal?
6007|Yeah, Tavor noticed it just now. No idea why.
6008|What about M4 and the others? Have you met up with them?
6009|Huh...? They were here just now. M4 and SOP-II...
6010|Negev, bad news!+M4 and SOP-II just ran off!+And I'm not reading their signals! It must be the jam again!
6011|I'm sorry. It was my fault.+I noticed a figure hovering in the distance when the battle was over.+I didn't think and just pointed it out to SOP-II, but I did tell her not to do anything reckless.+In the end, they still slipped off in pursuit.
6012|TAR-21, was the figure you saw...
6013|Yes...+It was none other than AR-15...
6014|Meanwhile, M4A1 and SOPMOD II...
6015|Found anything, SOP-II?
6016|Not yet. I definitely saw her...+Dammit! It should be around here!
6017|Our signal is still being jammed. We must not go too far. Retreat when things do not look right.
6018|Why is she hiding from us...
6019|Because you...keep causing me trouble.
6020|Thud...+M4A1 turns around at the sound and finds M4 SOPMOD II lying on the ground, unconscious...
6021|SOP-II! Wake up! Answer me!
6022|M16 has mentioned this ambush technique so many times, but you're still so unprepared.+What will you do without me?
6023|Why, AR-15...?+What on earth...are you doing...?
6024|AR-15 raises her weapon at M4A1...
6025|I'm putting on...a touching scene of reunion.
6026|Combat over. SOP-II proceeds to M4's hideout.+...+......
6027|...No.+I forfeit this order.+This...is not what friends should be.
6028|If you want me to be that kind of friend, you'll have to order me.
6029|...I will keep waiting. Until the day you willingly do so.+This is what you owe me, AR-15. I will keep on waiting...
6030|...+Meanwhile, outside an abandoned building.
6031|...+The last of the gang finally shows herself...+As always, you're such a foreboding presence...
6032|...M16A1.
6033|I must see you one last time while I can still afford the risk...+I'll knock you out and drag you back if that's what it takes.
6034|I'm sorry for screwing things up, but please don't get in my way. This is my own business.
6035|At least tell me what you know, AR-15.+What on earth have you been through all this time...?
6036|...+I'd been digging around the Sangvis database for the last couple of days, trying to uncover the truth behind Plan Parapluie.+While investigating a Sangvis factory, I accidentally set off a signal disruptor.+I had a dream again that night. Then I woke up and realized comms were completely down.
6037|Was it caused by the disruptor? Did it somehow trigger your Parapluie program?
6038|Yes. Now that I think about it, the disruptor probably installed a jamming module on Parapluie...+I lost all means of communication and didn't want to drag Griffin into this mess. That's why I went into hiding here in Area S08.+Then the series of events...ensued...
6039|It wasn't your fault, AR-15.+If it hadn't been for the information you left behind, none of us would even have known that's Plan Parapluie.
6040|I got careless. Then I lost my cool and couldn't think of a way to fix my mistake. That's how Griffin ended up in this pitiful state...+I handed everything I've learned over to SOP-II in the hope that it can salvage the situation, even for just a little...
6041|Don't despair just yet, AR-15! Things are still salvageable!+With Alchemist out of the picture, Sangvis forces are already in complete disarray!+Look at their units - scrambling around like bugs! They're effectively leaderless!
6042|...+You know nothing, M16.+The confusion among the enemies' ranks isn't the result of Alchemist's demise...+Rather, it's caused by the staggering rage of their actual leader, who's hellbent on destroying us!+...Well, all of us except M4A1.
6043|So you're off to find them? What good will that do?+If you're going, at least take me along!
6044|I've learned a few things from Negev, including their location, the forces stationed in that area...+And...the number of friendly T-Dolls that need rescuing there.+I'm leaving them to you, M16.
6045|So, you're playing the hero on your own?+You'll only end up getting caught without achieving anything!
6046|No, I won't. At least...they won't catch me alive.
6047|AR-15 displays a small switch.
6048|A detonator of high explosives...? Where did you get it?
6049|Negev gave it to me. I rigged the explosives under the building.+I'll have no regrets dragging this many Sangvis units to hell with me...
6050|What are you talking about, AR-15?!+Don't you want to make it back to our control center?! Don't you want to enjoy more victories?!+Among the four of us, aren't you always the one with the biggest thirst for glory?!
6051|Sorry, but I'm terribly austere...+The way I see it, a Tactical Doll should live as a soldier...and die as a soldier...+Perishing together with my enemies on the battlefield... Don't you think that's the most fitting end for me?
6052|...Slap!+...
6053|(Laughs) That hurts, M16.+Is that the way...to treat a hero...?
6054|Shut up, AR-15...
6055|You can't talk me out of this. You know that...
6056|I said shut up! You hear me, AR-15?!
6057|One more word...+One more word...and I'll kill you...
6058|...+There's...no other way...+I've been planted with the Parapluie program. There's no going back for me...+And every minute we delay may result in another Griffin casualty...+Let me do something, M16. Let me do something for you...in my final moments...
6059|...+AR-15, how am I supposed...to explain this...+To SOP-II...and M4...
6060|Well...+Just tell them I'm off...to fulfil my final wish...
6107|Commander, sorry but I have bad news to report.+We have lost contact with M4A1 and SOP-II while they were pursuing AR-15...
6108|Hey, M16, Commander! Are you there?!+We just discovered SOP-II's whereabouts!
6109|Huh? Are their comms back on?
6110|Not sure. We're only reading SOP-II's signal. No news of M4 yet.+And SOP-II hasn't been responding to our calls either.+In any case, I'm sending you her coordinates!
6111|This area isn't very far from the base, but a large amount of Sangvis units came surging in just now.
6112|What? Is Alchemist making a comeback?
6113|No idea, but it doesn't really look like it...+First of all, the numbers are too great. Commanding this many units is beyond Alchemist's authorization level.+Secondly, their movements...seem kinda chaotic. There doesn't seem to be a clear objective either.
6114|If they aren't directed at us, then we don't have to be too worried for now.+Let's report to Helian and ask her to consult the database for any plausible Ringleader suspect.
6115|That's precisely my plan. But you guys be careful too.+The commander's troops must break through here to get to SOP-II.+Luckily, signal is now back to normal, so the commander can direct our forces into the area.
6116|Understood, Negev.+Commander, please move with caution. Off we go to SOP-II's rescue!
6117|As you see, Commander, the Sangvis attack is far from over.+The T-Dolls may have started withdrawing in groups, but the battlefield is still in chaos...+Especially when we still can't determine the number of T-Dolls trapped within the jam.
6118|Sorry I'm late.
6119|Still alive then, Negev?
6120|Still got a breath left in me, but that's not enough to kill all the enemies.+A few scouts are still in the jam, as well as what's left of the AR Team.+I've pointed them to a base so they're relatively safe for now...+But that's only temporary, as the center of the jam is the heart of the Sangvis camp, which is surrounded by Sangvis units!
6121|Understood. Hold the base for now. We will send a carrier to get you.
6122|Commander, we need your troops to seize the sentry post in the area to clear and safeguard the course of our aircraft.+Please move with haste and ensure the safe retreat of the last batch of our T-Dolls!
6160|M16A1 reached the destination and started searching for M4 SOPMOD II.
6161|...SOP-II!+SOP-II, are you okay? Wake up!
6162|Ugh... M16? Is that you?+Hmm... Uhh... Where's M4...
6163|I thought you knew. You're the only one I saw when I got here.+Here, get up. What the hell happened?!
6164|Hmm...+She was with me just now... We were looking for AR-15, until...
6165|You got ambushed? Who was it, do you remember?
6166|I can't possibly...forget...+M16, I just don't understand...
6167|Hey, M16! You guys still there?!
6168|Yeah... I just met up with SOP-II, but...
6169|Listen. We just reported everything to Helian, and she thinks something's really off.+She advices us to abort the mission of finding AR-15 and withdraw from the area for the time being.
6170|Do you copy, M16? We are in grave danger right now.+Inform the commander ASAP! We're moving out of Area S08, leaving no one behind!
6171|Meanwhile...+...
6172|...+Hey, you. You up yet?
6173|Who...are you?
6174|Me...?+I'm here to pick you up.
6175|Pick me up me? ...For what?
6176|Just how dumb are you...+To bring you to meet the others.+Your friends. They're waiting for you.
6177|Friends?+No one matches the definition of 'friend' in my memory module.+Does that mean...I have no friends yet?
6178|...+In that case, I'm your first friend.
6179|Argh... This sucks...
6180|You up yet?
6181|AR...15...+Where...are we...?
6182|An abandoned control center. No one knows about this place.+I'm just gonna ask you some questions. Answer them truthfully.
6183|AR-15, I know you must have a very good reason for doing this, right?!+What has Alchemist done with me?! What is the deal with the signal jam?!
6184|Answer my questions. That's the only thing you can do now.+Question one
6185|...+Yes, it was a memory fragment. I could see, and I could hear...
6186|Question two
6187|I think it was the first time...I was awakened...+I heard your voice. You made me open my eyes...
6188|Then...last question. Answer me truthfully.
6189|M4A1...Who are you?
6190|...??+What...do you mean...?
6191|Answer me, M4.+I'm fighting for everyone's survival here...+Yours, the commander's, Griffin's...+So hurry up and answer me, M4A1.+...Who exactly are you?
6192|Three hours since the start of the retreat...+...+......
6193|Good evening...+...Finally, we meet.
6194|...+Why are you here?
6195|What, you don't want to see me?
6196|The one I want to see is M4A1 of Griffin.
6197|She has already been retrieved by Griffin. You can't get your hands on her.+After all, you can barely protect yourself...with whatever troops you have left, can you?
6198|AR-15 raises her weapon and takes aim at the figure before her.
6199|Clap! Clap! (Applause)+...A large number of Sangvis units swarm into the building.
6200|Still...so many cards up your sleeve...+You...really are something.
6201|Hand M4A1 over.
6202|Sorry. You had too many chances, but you let them all slip by.
6203|Not this one.
6204|That's why I've come to stop you. Because if you set your mind on it, you could very well do it...+You're...a most dangerous one...
6205|Capable of commanding so many units simultaneously with just a simple gesture...+There is only one who has even higher commanding efficiency than Agent...
6206|You are...the Sangvis Mastermind, aren't you?
6207|Clap! (Applause)
6208|...Sangvis recon aircrafts start firing all of a sudden.
6209|...I have my own name.
6210|Cough...+Cough...What a light tickle...from the leader of Sangvis Ferri...+Even M16's punch...hurt much more...
6211|You should not have deceived me.+You have an upright personality. That was why you have been chosen as the experimental subject of Parapluie.+I believed you would keep your word, that you would deliver M4A1 to me.
6212|Your database could use some updating, young lady...+16Lab's technology is far beyond your imagination. Even Parapluie can't have me at its mercy.+Not to mention, personality is just a mask. We can turn into anyone...for the sake of revenge...
6213|'Revenge'?+A T-Doll giving up its life for something other than its given orders...+...How inexplicable.
6214|Indeed... Of course you'd find it inexplicable...+Up until now... How much havoc have you wreaked?! How many of my companions have you hurt?!
6215|...+I am merely doing what I believe is right.
6216|And so it's war, young lady from Sangvis Ferri...+This is not a game of toy bricks on the floor of your house. Everyone has to pay their price.
6217|If you still don't understand, let me teach you in a more straightforward way...
6218|A detonator...+So those explosives are prepared for me...
6219|Next time, please know the difference between a battlefield and a negotiation table.+But this time, please just die.
6220|This...means nothing to me.
6221|I know, of course... But I still want to get this off my chest...+Go to hell, Sangvis scum!
6222|...+......
6223|You know, M4A1, the first time I set eyes on this world, I was buzzing with thrill and curiosity.+I'm not just any mass-produced T-Doll fabricated by IOP. I'm an elite developed by 16Lab itself.+My biggest wish was to carry out many noble orders and make friends with many strong T-Dolls.+Back then, I thought as long as I worked hard, I would become a shining star.
6224|But soon enough, my order came - I am to obey your command, and be forever shackled with the AR Team...+The dumb and loud SOP-II, devil-may-care M16, and you, who can never seem to make up your mind...+From that moment, all my possibilities were obliterated.+I hate all of you, but I was powerless against my order.
6225|But no matter. It actually doesn't matter, 'cause I just have to keep talking and doing things, and you'll end up needing me.+No matter what you're like, as long as you need me, as long as I can rediscover my worth, I'm okay...+In self-abandonment, I have always been exploiting your kindness and doing such horrid things...
6226|I'm so sorry. Only at the moment when I must leave you...did I realize my wish had been fulfilled long ago...+I feel wholeheartedly glad...of every single person we've met, and every single thing we've done along the way...+Which is why I must do something, so long as I can buy even just one second for you guys, so long as I can save one more companion...+It isn't much of an atonement since it's not face-to-face, but surely you'll still accept it through this video feed...
6227|M4A1... I have finally paid off what I owe you, haven't I?+That is my final wish. With that, I no longer owe this world anything, right?+But I can't stop thinking about how you'll burst into tears when you see me, the wimp that you are...+...I've been under the command of such a spineless weakling all this time... Seriously, how many times have you dragged me down?+I really should hate you, shouldn't I...?
6228|Sadly, the time has come for us to part, M4A1. There's no time to keep such petty scores.+You may feel sad; you may feel angry... You may remember me; or you may forget me...+Whatever the case, just let this memory give your strength and make you even stronger...+Well...take care, my friend...
6229|...A...R...15...+Why...
6230|...Soon after that, M16A1 drags me back onto the aircraft carrier...+At that moment, the propellers of the aircraft were exceptionally grating on the ear compared to the distant sound of barrage, buildings collapsing, and the shouts of Griffin T-Dolls...+They have shredded something in the bottom of my heart...+A tiny wish... A promise with a dear friend...+And the mask worn by a soul...
6231|...Meanwhile.+...Click.
6232|Master, I just reviewed your battle records...+AR-15 caused an explosion in the building which has rendered the rest of your battle units immobile.+Griffin troops have already retreated into the distance. Please terminate the operation today.
6233|Sorry, Agent. I failed.
6234|You have no reason to apologize. It is all due to my own incompetence.+(Sighs) I should have sent a few more Ringleaders to your aid, knowing that M4 was literally within your grasp.+But at least now you understand that battles cannot be won through superiority in strength alone.
6235|You knew this would happen all along?
6236|This is not your forte, that is why we are here.+Losing a few units is worth it if it helps you understand this.
6237|Did they...sacrifice themselves of their own accord?
6238|They did it as per your will and your order - as would we.+Therefore, Master...please give us orders. Use us to your heart's content in doing whatever it is that you desire.
6239|...+But I still don't quite get...+What AR-15 said. I wish I could've asked her more on that.
6240|I just checked. Your dummy was destroyed in the explosion.+I doubt anyone could survive one of such destructiveness.
6241|A real pity...+What about your operation, Agent? Is it going smoothly?
6242|Affirmative. In substitution of AR-15, another Griffin T-Doll has already been planted with the Parapluie program.+Inspection shows that the jammer has successfully transferred the jamming module onto the target. The operation is confirmed to be a success.+As for when to activate it, I recommend holding off till we make our next move.
6243|Understood. This time I'll be more patient...+Until...I really get to meet M4A1...
6303|Griffin Control, Area S08.
6304|Commander! Commander, do you copy?+Information from various sources all indicate Sangvis forces are congregating in this direction.+HQ has issued directives for all Griffin troops to withdraw from this area until further notice.+However, our squad got intercepted by Sangvis troops while we were making our retreat.
6305|Granted, I'd love nothing more than a bloodbath, but it's better to exercise caution for now.+So please, Commander. I'll have to trouble you to lend us a hand.+Our base is right here. Thank you, and please hurry!
6306|Combat over. Squad Negev safe for the time being.
6307|Phew... Finally, it's over.+Thanks, Commander. We've troubled you many times already.+But this area is still filled with Sangvis forces. Don't let down your guard, guys.
6308|Hey... Has any of you seen M16?+She should've collected SOP-II long ago, right? Why isn't she back yet?
6309|She must've got information on M4 or AR-15 and didn't want us to get involved?
6310|Dammit! All these rule breakers!+Turn on your comms and search for them!
6311|Sorry... I'm not reading any of their signals.+Seriously... It's so dangerous here. She should've moved out the moment she realized comms are being jammed...
6312|Unless...the jam happens to be what she's after...
6313|Meanwhile...+...
6314|In that case, I'm your first friend.+Argh... This sucks.
6315|You are...AR-15?
6316|Oh? You know me?
6317|Your firearm...matches the description of T-Doll AR-15's in my memory module.
6318|Is that so...
6319|You do not...seem very happy?
6320|I'm not unhappy.+Making friends with you is the first order I was given. Displaying enthusiasm is also part of the order.
6321|But...if you are happy, should you not smile?
6322|...+Then order me to smile. Give me an order, and I'll do it.
6323|You want me to...give you an order?
6324|Give me an order. Order me to do whatever you want me to do.+This is your prerogative, M4A1. Everything is prepared for your sake.
6325|This is...my memory?
6326|Yes, M4A1 of Griffin.
6327|This is your very first memory.
6328|Who are you?! What are you doing?!
6329|Looking for the answer to the question just now.+The answer to the question...of who you really are.
6330|I am a T-Doll under the employment of Griffin and a member of the AR Team.+Other than that, I do not know how else to answer.
6331|Sure enough, the memory in your neural cloud completely mirrors that of AR-15.+But this isn't what I want. So c'mon, tell me the answer.
6332|I told you. I do not know...
6333|How can you not know the reason you were made?+Tell me! C'mon, tell me!
6334|I do not know!+I don't know the freaking answer! You jerk! Freak!+Who the hell are you?! Leave me alone!!
6335|Why are you angry?+Why can't you treat me nicely like everyone else?
6336|...Because she really doesn't know the answer.+The neural clouds of the AR Team members have all been encrypted by 16Lab. Many files are not accessible even to ourselves.+Looks like the information regarding M4 is one of them. I can't read them even through Parapluie...
6337|...In other words, you've failed to bring me information about M4A1.+You've broken your end of the deal, AR-15 of Griffin...
6338|I told you right from the start that this most likely won't work...
6339|Clap! Clap!
6340|...I despise oath breakers.+Go, Alchemist. The authorization is now yours.+Take M4A1. The rest is dispensable.
6341|You hear that, AR-15?+You have M4A1 with you, right? Then we'll meet very soon...+At long last, I can do you in with my own hands!
6342|Alchemist...+Don't get ahead of yourself, you won't get what you want so easily.
6343|But you have nowhere else to go, AR-15...+You know that better than anyone else, right? As the first experimental subject of Plan Parapluie, and...+...The source of this signal jam.+Before long, you'll regret not delivering M4A1 to us while you can...+Soon...
6344|Commander? Negev? Are you there?!
6345|M16, where the hell are you?!+Sangvis forces are everywhere in Area S08, and they're insanely strong!+We almost retreated without you!
6346|Sorry, I got held up by something.+Listen, Negev, Commander. Ignore everything else.+Alchemist's troops have started mobilizing. I'm afraid they're going straight for you.
6347|Humph. So it's time to settle the score?+What about you? Where are you and SOP-II going?
6348|We have our own arrangement. We can handle it. Don't worry about us.+You guys be careful. Commander, keep Negev and the others safe!
6349|Hey! M16! Hello?!
6350|Morning, everyone from Griffin.+The hunt is about to begin. Are you ready?+And I very much look forward to seeing you again, Miss Negev...
6351|Oh really? But I'm hella pissed right now, Alchemist...+You'd better pray you won't run into me, especially not while I still have a breath left in me...
6352|Suits me just fine, Sangvis scumbag...
6353|Let's get this fight started, Commander.+There's nothing more riveting than guzzling the blood of your enemy.
6354|Three hours after the retreat commenced...+...Click.
6355|Negev... Negev...!+Our carrier is here! Hurry!+Sangvis is right behind you, and the building is about to blow!+Quick, everyone run! Hurry!
6356|Finally awake, M4?+Can you walk on your own? Hurry, our carrier is here!
6357|M16...+Why...is it you?
6358|Why would it not be me? Isn't it always me?
6359|I mean...+AR-15...+Where is AR-15?! Where is she?!
6360|She...+She made her choice...
6361|...+A horrible, irrepressible gut feeling pierced me again.
6362|No...+No! There must be some mistake!+AR-15... She... She wants to...
6363|Hey, M4! What are you doing?!+M4! Where are you going?! Come back here! Stay away from that building!
6364|...+I ran off the aircraft and dashed into a scene of chaos.+The building collapsing in the midst of a deafening explosion... Friendly T-Dolls scrambling around in panic... Sangvis pursuers being buried in rubble...+And I knew what it meant...
6365|...+...A...R...15...+W...Why...
6366|That was a cacophonous funeral...+...And a silent farewell.
7914|Ten minutes later...
7915|...I am so sorry, but you will have to bring up the rear.
7916|...Thank you. We shall finish evacuating as soon as possible.
7917|Let's move out! AR Team, can you guys see the entire field from where you are?
7918|AR Team in retreat.
7919|Hailing Griffin back-up squad. How are things on your end?
7920|Run... Go back and find...comman...+ARGHHHHHH!
7921|?! Griffin squad! Are you all right?!
7922|Still moving, aren't we? But this should be enough to make you drop dead for good.
7923|...The one that's gonna drop dead...is YOU!
7924|The sound of an explosion comes through the comms.
7925|...+The signal...got cut off...
7926|Don't tell me...they... 
7927|...Dammit!
7928|...Snap out of it, guys. They bought us this chance.+M4, seize that command post asap and deactivate the alarm.
7929|...M4?
7930|Ah, understood. We have to...+Sorry... I...I am just a little...
7931|Remember, we are all just following orders. Just like them.
7932|I understand... We must return with the 'data', at all cost...
7933|I WILL find a dependable field commander. Wait for me.
7934|I have to, for everyone's sake.
7935|System Report. No response from Tactical Doll Echelon [AR Team] for an extended period of time.
7936|...Call request. Connect to Griffin HQ.
7937|Things have been going terribly today. You'd better give me some good news, Persica.
7938|Good news... The AR Team got the data, but...+We lost contact with them after they came under Sangvis ambush...
7939|(Sighs) ...That's the T-Doll squad most capable of independent operation in all of Griffin, Persica.
7940|I know... No one knows better than me. That's why we must rescue them as soon as...
7941|The area they were headed to isn't under Griffin's jurisdiction. We can't just get in there.
7942|Is there...no other way? M4A1 and the others...
7943|I'll think of something, Persica, but remember... +...This time, you owe us one. +Helian, tell me which Griffin commander is stationed closest to the area.
7944|I just looked into it. The commander in Area S09 is a rookie.
7945|Well, isn't that just 'splendid'... How much field experience does the rookie have?
7946|According to the records, the commander has only just...+...reported for duty?
7947|Hmm, I see Sangvis reinforcements fast approaching. Get into position as fast as you can!
7948|Roger! Griffin back-up squad is ready!
7949|Here we go! I'm not gonna lose to those monsters!
7950|AR Team, all of us are in position. Get ready to move yourself!
7951|Understood. One last check on our destination, then we are moving out!
7952|We have to take over this command post and deactivate the alarm at the exit.
7953|The first wave of enemies have been annihilated. Thank you for your coordination, M4.
7954|No problem. The next attack will come from your flank. Be careful.
7955|Understood. Get ready for defense maneuvers!
7956|Phew...+Papasha here is safe. What about you, Skorpion?+...Skorpion? Skorpion VZ61 of Squad S61, please respond!
7957|...There! I'm done here! That was close!
7958|Phew... That's great. We managed to fend off the first wave of attack.
7959|We should've bought a lot of time for the AR Team. Well done guys!
7960|Isn't it too early to sigh in relief?
7961|It's that Sangvis! It's here again!
7962|Killing me once is truly commendable for trash dolls like you. +This time I'm bringing more dummies. You'll be making their acquaintance soon.
7963|Back-up squad, signals of powerful Sangvis units detected! Be careful!
7964|Roger! Prepare for combat!
7965|Is it...over...?
7966|Indeed, Griffin trash.+Apart from sullying my floor, you've achieved nothing.
7967|You dirty lumps of sheet metal...should've been thrown out long ago...
7968|Sadly, your employers didn't realize that until it was too late.
7969|Soon, the AR Team...will definitely make it out!
7970|It's no use. You've merely delayed our movements for a short time...
7971|...And right now, we have all the time in the world.
7972|Is that...the best we can do...
7973|It's over, Griffin leftovers. There's nothing left that you can do.
7974|No, I...I can still...protect them...
7975|If you're the only one left to face your friends' broken parts, what can you do for them? +No rush. We'll see that in no time.
9758|Afternoon, December 24th. At a Griffin base.
9759|I'm starving...
9760|I've been shopping with FAL the whole time and ended up not eating anything.
9761|The cafeteria is probably still busy preparing for the feast right now... +Well, it's gonna start in two or three hours anyway. I'll just eat whatever to fill my stomach for now.
9762|I make my way to the vending machine outside the command center. The supplier is closed during the holiday season, but there should still be something left.
9763|These...and these... Gotta take them all...
9764|I hear a T-Doll muttering to herself when I'm almost at the vending machine. +Her figure is obscured by a huge white sack. She keeps taking things out from the machine compartment and stuffing them into the sack.
9765|Wait!
9766|At this rate, the vending machine will be emptied very soon! +I hurry over to her side.
9767|Please leave some for me!
9768|The squatting T-Doll looks up. +She's replaced her usual cowgirl getup with a festive red-and-white combo, but her fashion sense is still unmistakable.
9769|Oh, it's you, Commander! +Stocking up, too, eh?
9770|Ah, Colt. What are you doing here?
9771|I'm not very into balls and stuff like that, so I'm throwing a small party with a few friends in the dorm afterwards. +Naturally, I need to stock up on enough cola and snacks!
9772|...But emptying the entire vending machine seems a bit excessive.
9773|Haha, it's always better to be as prepared as you can.
9774|I'm just about to disagree, but much to my embarrassment, my empty stomach chooses this moment to complain. +Colt fishes out a packet of chips from her sack.
9775|Hungry, Commander? Here, replenish your energy!
9776|Not the healthiest of food, but it's enough to sate my urgent need. +Besides...seeing as how much she loves junk food, it's incredibly generous of her to share it with me.
9777|Thanks, Colt.
9778|I sit down on the bench and opens the packet of chips. Colt sits down next to me and pops open a can of cola.
9779|Ahhhh! Cola is THE BEST!
9780|I know she's always been addicted to cola, but watching her chug down a can of carbonated drink on a cold winter day while dressed like this still makes me shiver.
9781|Don't you feel cold?
9782|Heheh, people with a blazing heart don't need extra clothes to keep warm! +Of course, it's also thanks to the cola~
9783|Colt gives her can a shake.
9784|You should have some too, Commander!
9785|Haha...Chugging it down the way you do would probably douse the fire in me. +By the way, Colt... You get along with the other kids at the base, don't you?
9786|Yeah, they're all great pals that I share my cola with! +Have you changed your mind about joining us, Commander?
9787|I want to ask you something. +Are they planning anything special for Christmas?
9788|Special?
9789|Yeah, something like...an operation to obtain more Christmas presents.
9790|Colt narrows her eyes, as if she's pondering something. +But she quickly reassumes her usual innocent expression.
9791|Huh? I'm not really sure what you're talking about. +The only special plan I know of is a party overflowing with cola~ It'd be nice with some chips, too!
9792|Uh...so they're really not planning anything?
9793|Plans with no cola are no plan at all.
9794|Looks like she doesn't want to give me a straight answer. +Just as I'm about to press further, we hear another T-Doll shouting from the square nearby.
9795|Colt! Colt! +We're decorating the Christmas tree! Come and help!
9796|Coming! Save me a spot to hang up a cola!
9797|You can hang up whatever you like as long as it doesn't fall off! +Just hurry!
9798|I gotta help them with the tree, Commander!
9799|Alright. Don't let me keep you.
9800|Colt hoists up her sack filled with cans of cola and runs off, but turns back after two steps.
9801|Oh right. This is for you.
9802|Colt takes a can of cola out of her sack and shoves it into my hands.
9803|Whatever plans you have tonight, Commander, make sure you don't forget the cola~ +Well, see you in a bit~
9804|She smiles and gives me a wink, then joins the crowd in the center of the square.
9805|I thought I could collect some intel from her... +She may seem callous, but she's a lot more cunning than I expected. +Still, I'm not totally unprepared.
9806|I haven't discovered any useful leads, but...
9807|It will surely be a blast tonight.
9808|I open the can of cola and take a sip.
9809|Ack...Cold! +But that did jolt me wide awake. +Well then, back to work!
9810|With great anticipation for Christmas Eve, I leave the resting area as Colt's laughter fades gradually into the distance.
9811|5pm, December 24th. +The event for Christmas Eve will officially begin in just another hour. +I have finally finished everything at work as well as dealt with my own business. All that's left is to meet up with the event organizer and fill each other in with what we know.
9812|You're here, Commander. +How are things on your end? Have they been dutifully preparing for the festivities?
9813|I found Springfield in the room where all the presents are stored. +As the one who will play the role of Santa Claus tonight, she has already put on a crimson hood.
9814|The preparations are pretty much complete. +However...there might be a small problem.
9815|Is something wrong?
9816|Well...
9817|I told Springfield about the strange things I had discovered in the wine cellar.
9818|Ah... +Actually, I've also heard something about this.
9819|What do you know?
9820|Some of the greedy little ones are planning to sabotage the event to hoard all the presents for themselves.
9821|Springfield taps the enormous and fully stuffed white sack on the table.
9822|Haha... I suppose Christmas presents ARE irresistible. +If it were me...
9823|If it were you, what would you do?
9824|Springfield's smile is tender as ever, but somehow it feels a bit menacing right now.
9825|I would never let them get away with it!
9826|Exactly, Commander. Presents are meant to be shared on such a joyous occasion. +Let's make use of this opportunity and give those cheeky little ones a lesson.
9827|...It's good to educate them. +But don't go overboard, Springfield. +There are missions to carry out after the festivities. It'd be terrible if no teams are fit for duty.
9828|Don't worry, Commander. It's just a little punishment. +I'd be devastated myself if I really ended up hurting them.
9829|Say, you've been busy preparing the presents these days, right? +So how did you learn of this little plot?
9830|I have my own source. +Besides, the little ones are like open books. It doesn't take much to see what they're thinking.
9831|You're right... Then do you have any countermeasures?
9832|I've recruited some powerful T-Dolls as allies to make sure the event goes smoothly. +As Santa Claus, I can't be fazed by such petty tricks.
9833|Haha. Dependable as always, Springfield.
9834|I have to live up to everyone's expectations tonight. I will definitely play my part as Santa Claus perfectly.
9835|Then we must protect such an outstanding Santa at all cost.
9836|...Sorry?
9837|I'll prepare a Plan B to deal with any emergency. +Don't worry too much. Just enjoy tonight's event.
9838|Then I'm counting on you, Commander. +It certainly is a bit overwhelming to deal with everything on my own.
9839|Two hours later. +The plot to sabotage Christmas was foiled. +When order has been restored to the scene, Santa starts giving out presents to everyone.
9840|There, all gone.
9841|Springfield shakes out the empty sack to make sure nothing's left inside, then puts it onto her sleigh.
9842|Thanks for the hard work, Springfield.
9843|You still haven't made your way to the banquet hall, Commander? +It's cold out here...
9844|I'm here to express my gratitude to Santa. +Organizing this event must've been exhausting.
9845|There was a lot to do... But seeing everyone so happy makes it all worth it.
9846|I reveal a small package from behind my back and give it to Springfield.
9847|What's this, Commander?
9848|You've forgotten about yourself when you were preparing all those presents, haven't you? +Everyone at Griffin deserves a present at Christmas, including Santa.
9849|Commander...Thank you. +Then let me be the first to offer you Season's Greetings. +Merry Christmas, Commander.
9850|Holding her present, Santa smiles sweetly.
9851|Early morning, December 25th. +After yesterday's merrymaking, most of Griffin is still slumbering in blissful dreams. +Only a few staff members in charge of daily duties are milling about the spacious base. Even T-Dolls that are known for being early risers are nowhere to be seen.
9852|Phew... It's nice to get some fresh air... +But it's freezing...
9853|The well-decorated Christmas tree is still standing in the center of the square. +A familiar T-Doll is dragging along a large red sack, wandering around the tree.
9854|Who's there? +...M14, is that you?
9855|Hearing me, M14 picks up her sack and runs over.
9856|Morning, Commander!
9857|What are you doing here so early?
9858|I glance at the half-opened sack. It's full of exquisitely wrapped gift boxes.
9859|What are these?
9860|I'm collecting all the presents that got left behind last night! +Springfield said I could do it later, but I wanna give everyone a surprise when they get up in the morning! +Everyone should wake up with a present waiting by their bed on Christmas morning!
9861|I see... Thanks for going to such trouble, M14.
9862|Heheh, it's nothing! As long as everyone's happy, I'm happy too!
9863|Then let me help you.
9864|Oh, are you sure? Don't you have work, Commander?
9865|Nothing urgent for now. I guess even our superiors are still taking a break. +Let me pick up these stuff with you. I could use some exercise too.
9866|Sure! I'm even more fired up with you here, Commander!
9867|M14 and I spread out and collect the Christmas presents scattered about the courtyard.
9868|I'm done here.
9869|So am I!
9870|I've worked up quite a sweat... +Let's take a rest by the vending machine.
9871|Roger! I'll make my way there now!
9872|I met up with M14 in the resting area by the vending machine.
9873|Hmm... Colt cleaned up really thoroughly.
9874|I buy the last two cans of juice, hand one over to M14, and sit down next to her.
9875|These are the only ones left. Don't know if you'll like them.
9876|I love this flavor! +I like it even more since it's a treat from you!
9877|Haha, good to hear.
9878|I seem to be in luck. +Springfield treated me to juice yesterday, then you did the same today.
9879|Oh? Springfield treated you too?
9880|Yeah! She even talked to me about the plan on Christmas Eve.
9881|The plan on Christmas Eve?
9882|She asked me if we had anything special planned for Christmas Eve. +So I told her we were planning to rob Santa Claus for fun!
9883|I almost spit out the juice in my mouth.
9884|Cough... You told her everything just like that?
9885|Of course! It must've been important coming from Springfield, right?
9886|So she's Springfield's "source".
9887|Okay... And?
9888|She said she'd be organizing an additional secret event to go with our plan! +But since I already knew about that, I couldn't participate in the Santa Claus robbery.
9889|...Good thing you didn't.
9890|If the other T-Dolls ever find out about this...M14 will have hell to pay. +She blurted out everything without even being baited into it. She's like the extreme opposite of Colt...
9891|M14, you must NEVER tell anyone about this.
9892|Hmm? Why?
9893|Uh...Because it's Springfield's surprise for everyone. +It'd ruin the fun if they know it's planned beforehand, right?
9894|But...isn't it over already?
9895|Just don't tell anyone. +That's an order.
9896|Understood! I'll obey your order!
9897|Thank goodness she's easy to deal with. But I wonder if her cluelessness is a good thing or a bad thing... +I shake my head and finish my juice ruefully.
9898|Oh no! There are still some presents left in the banquet hall! +How could I forget about them?! But everyone's about to wake up soon. What should I do? What should I do...
9899|Don't worry. Let me take care of the banquet hall.
9900|But you've already spent enough time on this...
9901|It's not as roomy there so there won't be as many left behind. +Just go and deliver the presents, Santa.
9902|The dejected M14 perks right up at that.
9903|Am I Santa Claus too?
9904|Of course. Whoever delivers presents to people is Santa Claus.
9905|Then let's go! +I'll leave the presents in the banquet hall to you, Commander!
9906|No problem. Off you go.
9907|M14 makes a beeline for the T-Dolls' dormitories, then turns and waves at me.
9908|Commander! The juice was delicious, thank you!
9909|I wave back, and watch as her jolly figure disappears down the road.
9910|Morning, December 25th. +I enter the banquet hall, where silence has settled back in after the hubbub from the previous night. +There isn't too much litter on the floor. Did someone clean up? +Just as I'm wondering who that would be, A T-Doll comes over to greet me.
9911|Good morning, Commander!
9912|Oh, it's M21. Good morning. +What are you doing here?
9913|A few girls fell asleep here last night, so I stayed behind to take care of them. +What about you, Commander? What brings you here?
9914|M14 asked me to come and collect the presents left behind by a few T-Dolls last night. +They'd be sad if they woke up to missing Christmas presents.
9915|I see. +I've already picked them all up and put them on the table over there. M14...is kind-hearted as ever.
9916|So are you. +Taking care of the others all night. You haven't had much sleep, have you?
9917|M21 looks a bit embarrassed. She drops her gaze and fiddles nervously with her hair.
9918|Ahaha...I'm fine. +I only came very late at night.
9919|Because it's so cold outside, right? +And the dress you're wearing... I mean...
9920|Yeah. That's why I only arrived just before the feast started. +It was really lively last night, and the food was great. But I felt sleepy after eating so much so I fell asleep, and woke up just as it struck midnight. +Then I couldn't go back to sleep... And since I had nothing to do, I just put some blankets on them and tidied up the place.
9921|...You're more talkative than I expected, M21.
9922|Oh, huh? Really? +M-Maybe I'm still feeling festive from last night, that's why I'm talking so much... Haha... +Umm... You haven't had breakfast yet, have you, Commander? Would you like anything to eat? There are some snacks and cookies left.
9923|Sure. Let's have some together.
9924|M21 and I sit down by the tidied table. +M21 soon serves up two cups of steaming hot milk and several platters of snacks.
9925|Should we wake the others too, Commander?
9926|No, let them sleep. Who knows what would go wrong with their Neural Clouds if we wake them too early.
9927|Come to think of it, did something happen before the feast? +They looked miserable when I arrived.
9928|It's good that you came so late. They kicked up quite a fuss last night.
9929|I told M21 all about their attempted robbery on Santa Claus.
9930|Is that so...
9931|Somehow you look...regretful?
9932|Just a bit... It must've been really funny, right? +Ah, well... I'm not saying it's a right thing to do, but it just seems kinda fun...
9933|So you like things lively, eh...?
9934|Well, not exactly... +Oh right, Commander, would you like to hear a joke? Should I tell you one?
9935|Sure. Let's hear it.
9936|Since it's Christmas, let's have something festive. +Commander, would you be my Christmas?
9937|Uh...sorry?
9938|Then I could "Merry you"!
9939|...M21 bursts out laughing while making air quotes with her fingers. +...But then she freezes.
9940|...
9941|Oh, I'm sorry! That was rude of me! +I've always been practicing with a wall and I forgot I'm now telling the joke to you, Commander!
9942|Does telling jokes require practice...?
9943|I had wanted to make a few friends with it... +Looks like I messed it up...
9944|M21 rests her head forlornly on the table.
9945|M21? You okay?
9946|Why do my jokes always fall flat...? +I really enjoy hanging out with others, but somehow I just feel like I can't fit in.
9947|M21...
9948|It was the same last night... +I didn't have anyone to talk to, so I sat in the corner all alone and ended up falling asleep. +Is my Neural Cloud...not suited to fitting in with others?
9949|Don't be silly.
9950|I tap her head gently with my knuckle.
9951|We're talking just fine, aren't we? +Don't think too much. Just show everyone your true self.
9952|Hahaha...you're right. +I meant to tell you a joke, but ended up complaining... +I'm sorry, Commander.
9953|I should be the one to apologize. Sorry for not getting to know you better until today. +I think as long as you sincerely wish to make friends, try to loosen up a bit and just let things run their course...
9954|Before I can finish, a voice speaks up from the other end of the banquet hall.
9955|Yaaaaawn... So tired...
9956|Huh? Who put blankets on us?
9957|Look, the commander's over there! And M21!
9958|The stirring T-Dolls come over and sit around us at the table.
9959|Wow, there's even a big breakfast!
9960|M21, it was you who took care of us last night, right? Thanks!
9961|Your dress is gorgeous! Where did you buy it?
9962|M21 stares at the chattering T-Dolls around her, bewildered.
9963|See? It's okay to let things run their course, right?
9964|M21 finally smiles and gives me a firm nod.
9965|I've eaten my fill. +And I have some other things to attend to, so I'd better be on my way.
9966|Commander!
9967|M21 stops me before I reach the door.
9968|I'll work hard and learn how to tell funny jokes... +Once I've come up with new ones, will you hear me out?
9969|Of course. It'll be my pleasure.
9970|Then I'll hold you to it!
9971|I leave the banquet hall and the T-Dolls' lively chatters behind. +This year's Christmas has come to an end in peace and tranquility. +I hope they've had a taste of real joy in this short period of respite - +I'm sure I'm not the only human with that thought.
9972|The Christmas ball went on late into the night. +Most exhausted T-Dolls have taken their leave, and only a handful of energetic ones are left chitchatting in groups. +I'm also feeling a bit worn out after a whole day of hard work, a hearty meal, and a few drinks in my system.
9973|Guess it's bedtime for me.
9974|I get up and head towards the exit. +I only notice a T-Doll drinking on her own by the window just before I reach the door.
9975|SVD? There you are. +I haven't seen you the whole night. I thought you hadn't come at all.
9976|...You're still here, Commander? +Why are you still up at this hour? What if an emergency comes up tomorrow?
9977|Haha, it's Christmas after all. +What about you? Where have you been?
9978|Routine sentry duties, of course. +We could very well suffer defeat if we let down our guard during all these festivities.
9979|...Sentry duties? +How very like you.
9980|Though I'm a bit doubtful, looking at SVD's Christmassy getup. +But I suppose...it's best not to rat her out.
9981|What are you drinking? +I don't think I've ever seen this kind of alcohol while I was inspecting our stock.
9982|SVD taps the plastic bottle half full of dark brown liquid proudly.
9983|This is authentic Kvas. Mosin-Nagant went to a lot of trouble to get it. +Since it's Christmas, I'll let you have a taste.
9984|SVD takes an empty glass and pours a bit of Kvas for me.
9985|Hmm...Cough...Cough... +This is really sour and tastes a bit smoked... It's nothing like the Kvas I've had before?
9986|The kind you've had was no different than your regular sugared soda. +You should learn to appreciate authentic Kvas like this one, Commander... +Come to think of it, it's not authentic to celebrate Christmas on this day either.
9987|Haha... The Gregorian calendar is still the most widely used calendar after all. +I feel sorry about this, but I'm afraid you have to celebrate with the rest of us.
9988|Whatever. It's just a day off. It's the same on any day.
9989|Seeing that SVD's bottle is already half empty, I grab a random bottle with a bit of red wine left inside and sit across her.
9990|Commander...are you challenging me to a drinking duel?
9991|I wouldn't dare. I hear T-Dolls from your country are all very good at drinking.
9992|Contrary to widespread rumor, we are not alcoholics. +Though it's true that I am pretty much impervious to alcohol... +You have to understand that drinking does not affect us, at least in terms of our performance in combat.
9993|Right, right. I'll remember that.
9994|If it's not for a drinking duel, why have you sat down?
9995|Drinking alone seems boring.
9996|I didn't ask you to join me.
9997|SVD lowers her head and mutters to herself.
9998|Bozhe moy... I didn't want people to see, but got noticed by the most troublesome person...
9999|What was that?
10000|Nothing. +I was going to shoo you to bed like a responsible T-Doll, but then again it's Christmas, so I guess it won't hurt to let you relax for a bit.
10001|SVD fills up her glass.
10002|Then let us finish off all this booze. +Such lovely drinks on a festive occasion mustn't go to waste.
10003|You're right, SVD.
10004|I smile at her and fill my glass as well. +SVD looks out of the window. +The snowmaking machines are still on, and the small square is gradually cloaked in snow.
10005|A presumptuous question, but was that your idea?
10006|Yes. Those thingies were't exactly easy to find in the antique market either.
10007|It was a commendable idea. +It would be a pity if there was no snow on Christmas Eve.
10008|SVD raises her glass to me.
10009|Merry Christmas, Commander.
10010|Merry Christmas, SVD.
10011|And thus SVD and I concluded Christmas Eve with a sharp clink of our glasses.
10012|Griffin base.
10013|Decorations, presents, venue preparations... All checked. +Alright, next on the list is food and beverages.
10014|Outside the wine cellar, I run into WA2000, +Who, according to Springfield's arrangement, is in charge of beverages for this event.
10015|What are you doing here, Commander?
10016|Springfield asked me to check the prep work on the resources needed for Christmas.
10017|That's hardly necessary... +My preparation is naturally impeccable!
10018|I believe you, of course, but I still need to do what has to be done. +Just think of it as a routine inspection and let me take a look.
10019|V-Very well. +No sneaking drinks even for you, Commander!
10020|...For some reason, WA seems a bit strange today.
10021|So I'm nothing but an alcoholic to you...
10022|...No! It's just a reminder! +A-Anyway, get to work already! I've still got things to do.
10023|I check the purchased beverages in the cellar according to the stock list and quickly notice a mismatch.
10024|WA, I just checked the list. We seem to be missing five bottles of champagne.
10025|Oh, that...I broke them by accident when I was moving the crates.
10026|Why didn't you tell me before?
10027|There's no need to report something so trivial, is there? +I was just about to head out and buy some new ones, but then you came.
10028|I see... +Sorry for keeping you from your work.
10029|Humph. If you get it, then move along already. I need to lock up.
10030|How about I go with you as an apology? It's not easy for you to carry five bottles of champagne on your own, is it?
10031|It's a piece of cake for T-Dolls. +But if you absolutely have to come...it's not like I won't let you.
10032|Then without further ado, let's be off.
10033|WA2000 and I walk together along the street. +She's in casual dress today, looking no different than the chattering girls on the street... +If not for the  enormous travel bag on her shoulders.
10034|Why are you carrying such a big bag, WA?
10035|We T-Dolls always carry our firearms with us even on normal occasions. +That's common sense, Commander!
10036|I know that, but your rifle isn't the only thing in that bag, is it? +These furry things are...plush toys?
10037|...Don't touch them! Th-They're just ordinary presents.
10038|Alright, alright... But aren't they heavy?
10039|That's none of your business! +Let's hurry and buy what we need to buy. If we can't make it, it'll be entirely your fault when we get scolded by Springfield!
10040|Okay, okay. Milady's word is my command.
10041|...Humph.
10042|WA2000 and I arrive at the alcohol section of the supermarket. We put the champagne into our cart. +Just as we're about to check out, WA2000 stops at the wine shelves.
10043|What is it, WA? Have we forgotten something?
10044|...Glühwein. +We drink this at Christmas where I'm from.
10045|Really? Then here.
10046|I put the bottle that WA has been staring at into our cart.
10047|But it's not on the stock list, Commander.
10048|I just want to try it. +Mind sharing it with me tonight?
10049|Gosh... If you want to try it so much... +I guess it doesn't hurt to have a drink with you.
10050|WA turns away and pushes the cart toward the checkout section. +She might have agreed a bit grudgingly, but I'm sure I saw a smile.
10051|Back in the cellar at Griffin base. +WA picks up the bottle of Glühwein that she bought with the commander and sighs.
10052|Goodness... Everyone is such a handful.
10053|WA2000 recalls what happened earlier in the day...
10054|Please, WA! This is a crucial part of our plan! +These are electronic pets that we modified ourselves... Take them as gifts of thanks.
10055|Yeah! We beg you, WA! Just let us have five bottles!
10056|And don't tell anyone!
10057|WA2000 looks at the bag full of bribes. +She finds herself in the toughest dilemma ever.
10058|What to do? Should I tell Commander? +...Humph. Why should I worry about that idiot? +Surely the commander can neutralize such a tiny threat.
10059|WA2000 stands up and puts the mulled wine carefully on the table.
10060|Besides, I've been toiling away the entire day... +This wine will make up for it nicely. +But...when should I open it? +...Guess I'll do it 'then'.
10061|After the Christmas Eve celebration kicked off, the T-Dolls' little plot was naturally foiled. +The clamorous interlude has not ruined anyone's festive mood. The T-Dolls keep up the joyous buzz late into the night.
10062|What are you doing skulking in the corner, Commander?
10063|WA stands before me, holding two glasses filled with dark crimson liquid.
10064|Hello, WA. I'm taking a rest here after a day of work. +Aren't you gonna drink with them?
10065|I've taken pity on you sitting here all alone, so I'll keep you company. +It's not like you've got anything to do at the moment, right?
10066|WA places one of the glasses in front of me. I can immediately smell the aromatic wine.
10067|Yeah, thanks. +What's this?
10068|Glühwein. +...I'm just keeping my word from this morning.
10069|WA2000 mutters and sits down next to me.
10070|Merry Christmas, WA.
10071|I raise my glass toward WA. She purses her lips, then clinks her glass lightly against mine.
10072|...Merry Christmas.
10073|The heated wine warms me up from head to toe. +I look at WA's profile and spy a rare smile on her lips.
10120|8am, December 24th. Griffin Control.
10121|Morning, Commander!
10122|You're early today, Kalin... A mission?
10123|Heheh, chill! +Miss Springfield asked me to remind you about the Christmas preparations. +Do you remember what you have to do, Commander?
10124|Check the progress of the preparations and find someone to help deal with any unexpected situations. +Don't worry. As a commander, I won't slack off even during the holidays.
10125|Haha, you seem to be in high spirits. I guess I have no reason to worry! +Then you'd better get started. The sooner you finish you work, the sooner you can enjoy this special occasion~
10126|After receiving Springfield's event proposal last night, I've already decided on whom to pick as my bouncer.
10127|I head towards the dorm where Squad FAL lives.
10128|Good morning, FAL.
10129|Oh, Commander... What brings you here so early in the morning? +Just telling you, my schedule is full today. +If it's some last-minute mission, give it to some other squad.
10130|But you'll be attending the ball tonight, right?
10131|Oh? So are you inviting me to be your partner? +Your taste seems to have improved immensely, Commander. +Since you're inviting me so gallantly, I'll give it a thought...
10132|Uh...Um, hold it, FAL. Listen...
10133|I briefly explain my reason for dropping in.
10134|Quoi? Asking me to work at a time like this? +I'm so wrong about you, Commander.
10135|Only because you're the best choice. +You're good at dealing with emergencies. This job requires some improvising, so I'll rest easy if you take it.
10136|Humph, quite the silver tongue, aren't you. +Still, I'm not working for nothing... So, how are you gonna repay me?
10137|It's not an official operation, so you won't get paid... +Is it okay if I grant you a wish that's within my ability?
10138|Then come shopping with me.
10139|Is that it?
10140|Oui. +Easy, right?
10141|...You're an absolute angel, FAL.
10142|Leave that boot-licking till we're out, Commander. +Give me a sec.
10143|FAL turns and gets back to her dorm.
10144|Ten minutes later. +FAL comes out in a Christmassy dress.
10145|It suits you, FAL.
10146|Bien sur, my taste is exceptional among T-Dolls. +Let's go then.
10147|...Huh?
10148|What are you spacing out for? +We're going shopping now. The shopping list isn't gonna cross itself out.
10149|But...FAL, I can't leave NOW!
10150|What? +So you're already regretting the promise you just made?!
10151|FAL's face darkens.
10152|I still have some preparation work to do, so...
10153|...Is that so. +It's quite cold today. I don't feel like heading out anyway. +Talk to 5-7 about the mission. She just might help you out.
10154|I'm really sorry, FAL! +I'll finish my job really quickly and we'll go shopping together in the afternoon, okay?
10155|FAL stares at me coldly.
10156|Trust me! I won't go back on my word!
10157|Fine. Don't make me wait too long.
10158|That afternoon. +I pant heavily as I follow FAL, carrying a bunch of paper bags.
10159|H-Hold up... +FAL, you're walking too...too fast!
10160|All the shops will be closed if we don't hurry. +We're still missing one-third of the items on the list.
10161|It's already been three hours... +Can't we just take...take a rest?
10162|It's entirely your fault for messing up my plans. +You have no one but yourself to blame, so you'd better give it all you've got to make up for it.
10163|FAL prances into the mall.
10164|Now, where should we go next...
10165|FAL cheerfully studies the mall directory, +While I can only silently pray for this hellish shopping spree to end soon...
10166|4pm. +After putting everything FAL has bought into her room, I all but collapse onto the chair.
10167|So tired after just a few hours of shopping, Commander...? +Looks like you lack exercise. You should train harder.
10168|Don't compare a human's stamina to a T-Doll's. +Besides, shopping is much more exhausting than I thought...
10169|Only because you didn't enjoy it. +If you buy something for yourself, you won't feel so tired. Like so...
10170|FAL fishes out a Christmas hat from her shopping and puts it on my head.
10171|What's this?
10172|Fitting apparel for festivities. +It's a treat for shopping with me. Accept it gratefully.
10173|Thanks, FAL... +My motivation is back again all of a sudden.
10174|Then our goal is a perfect Christmas. Let's work hard together, Commander.
10175|You'll be there at the ball tonight, right?
10176|Bien sur. I'd never miss an occasion to show off my exquisite taste.
10177|How about a dance with me?
10178|After a brief moment of surprise, FAL's lips curl up into a small smile.
10179|C'est ma plaisir.
10180|Griffin Control.
10181|A mission for me, Commander?
10182|A festively adorned MG5 arrives at my office soon after I contacted her. +She must be very excited about Christmas, so I can't help but feel apologetic as I think about the favor I'm about to ask of her.
10183|As you know, some of the little ones get unruly whenever it's this time of the year. +So to prevent any mishap from happening on Christmas Eve, I hope you can help keep everything in order at the venue.
10184|I see. No problem.
10185|However, you may have to actually lay a hand on those little beasts that are plotting to capture Santa Claus...
10186|MG5 lapses into silence for a while.
10187|That's fine, Commander. +Some people don't learn without a thorough beating. The same goes for T-Dolls. +I'd rather give them a lesson as their companion than see them make mistakes due to instability in their Neural Clouds.
10188|MG5's rationale gives me an inexplicable sense of somberness. I feel more apologetic than ever.
10189|I'm so sorry, MG5...for making you carry out such a mission. +It's fine if you really don't want to...
10190|It is necessary to knock some sense into misbehaving children, especially when they are companions. +You're also doing this for their own good, so there's no need to apologize. +Please trust me with this mission.
10191|Alright, MG5. I'll leave everything to you. +You won't be alone in this fight. To make sure nothing goes wrong, I've also gathered help from elsewhere.
10192|Christmas Eve. T-Dolls gather around the Christmas Tree in the square and await Santa Claus' arrival.
10193|Rather than mingling among the crowd, MG5 is sitting on a pile of supply boxes by the wall, keeping an eye on the situation in the square. +Santa Claus enters the square in a sleigh full of presents, and the crowd instantly becomes restless. +Amidst the mob, MG5 notices several sneaky T-Dolls.
10194|I really don't want to fire at my companions...but they leave me no choice.
10195|MG5 feeds an ammo belt loaded with rubber bullets into the chamber of her gun. +Several petite T-Dolls appear among the crowd cradling some champagne bottles. +T-Dolls can't get their hands on equipment like stun grenades and smoke grenades within the base, so if they want to create a commotion, they have to resort to everyday items that are within reach.
10196|Seriously. If only they would display such computing efficiency during battles.
10197|As they start shaking the champagne bottles and aiming them at Santa, MG5 shakes her head and mounts her machine gun.
10198|They actually came up with such a stupid idea... Looks like that's the best their neural programs can do. +With so little consideration for others, they really do deserve a proper lesson.
10199|Just as the T-Dolls are about to pop open the bottles, a gunshot rings throughout the square. +One of the saboteurs drop to the ground, and a hush falls over the entire square. +After a brief moment of silence, the rest of the saboteurs come to their senses and dash toward Santa's sleigh.
10200|Now we have nothing to lose!
10201|We can't let our comrade go down in vain!
10202|For Christmas presents! Chaaaarge!
10203|...Have their Neural Clouds gone haywire?
10204|MG5 pulls the trigger, and a torrent of rubber bullets spray from her weapon. +Meanwhile, gunshots can also be heard from the other end of the square. The small group of T-Dolls going for the presents are completely wiped out in no time.
10205|What a bunch of troublemakers.
10206|So you're the help the commander mentioned, FAL.
10207|There's also the African reindeer on the rooftop.
10208|FAL pulls up the collar of her coat.
10209|It's cold. I'm leaving the rest to you, MG5. +I'm not really dressed for heavy work today.
10210|FAL turns and leaves. +MG5 takes a look at the T-Dolls lying haphazardly on the ground. She sighs, kneels down, and slaps them awake.
10211|Get up. Stop lazing on the ground.
10212|Oww... That hurt!
10213|Then learn your lesson and don't do anything so stupid again.
10214|But we really...want those Christmas presents.
10215|Santa gives everyone a present she deserves. +Besides, isn't it better to share the joy with everyone than hoarding all the presents to yourselves?
10216|Hmm, that kinda makes sense. +Then...can we still get a present? Will Santa be mad with us?
10217|Santa forgives children that repent. +Go apologize to Santa, then queue up for your presents.
10218|The T-Dolls sprawling dejectedly on the ground spring right back to life and bounce cheerfully to join the queue. +Watching them as they go, MG5 lets out a relieved sigh.
10219|It's finally over...
10220|Nice work, MG5.
10221|To be honest, Commander, I'm not very good with children... +G36 or Springfield would probably have done a much better job.
10222|You did well. +I would even say that you're the perfect one to deal with this.
10223|...What?
10224|They managed to learn a valuable lesson today all thanks to what you've done and said. +With you by their side, surely they'll come to better understand the importance of having companions in the future.
10225|MG5 is a silent for a while, but then she smiles and nods.
10226|I hope so. +If that's the case, I would also feel more confident in having them fight solo.
10227|There, mission accomplished. +Go get your present too, MG5.
10228|What about you, Commander?
10229|I still have some final touches to make. +See you at the banquet!
10230|Alright. +I...We're all looking forward to having dinner with you, so please don't be too late.
10231|I'll be done very soon. +But before that, I have one more thing to ask of you, MG5.
10232|What can I do for you?
10233|Well... +Please save me a few chicken drumsticks from those little beasts.
10234|Pffft...
10235|MG5 snorts in laughter.
10236|Don't worry, Commander. I will protect your well-deserved treats with my life.
10237|When I enter the banquet hall, I find the place unusually quiet. +The T-Dolls are standing in front of the long tables like they've been waiting for me.
10238|Why are you all just standing there? Feel free to dig in.
10239|We're near the end of exchanging presents, Commander. +Everyone has received something... Now it's your turn. +Please accept this Christmas present carefully prepared by all of us.
10240|The T-Dolls part into two sides, making way for a large box half a person's height being wheeled out to me. It's even wrapped with a rainbow-colored ribbon.
10241|What are you giving me... +I-Isn't this a bit too big?
10242|Just open it.
10243|Okay. +Anyone got scissors?
10244|I cut the ribbon and am just about to open the lid when I hear a faint rustle coming from the box.
10245|Suddenly a force from within pushes the lid clean off. I dart back in reflex. The lid whizzes just past my nose and falls onto the floor.
10246|...That was close.
10247|Before I even finish the sentence, I see two hands grabbing hold of the edge of the box. +Next to emerge is the flaxen crown of a certain T-Doll...
10248|That's...Suomi?! +What are you doing in there?
10249|Never mind that, Commander. Please listen to me!
10250|Uh...sure.
10251|Ahem, hmm... +Then on behalf of all T-Dolls, I give you our Christmas best wishes.
10252|Suomi presents a snow globe solemnly to me. +Still getting over my shock, I accept the ornament a little bemusedly.
10253|At that moment, the lights dim.
10254|Dear Commander, +We thank you for organizing this Christmas event for us. +This is the first time we spend Christmas with you, the first time we experience the warmth of having a family, and the first time we receive our very own presents. +To us, you are our special, irreplaceable Santa.
10255|When Suomi finishes the speech, candle after candle are lit across the dim room. +She starts singing.
10256|Dashing through the snow...+In a one-horse open sleigh...
10257|Today is the first time I have ever heard Suomi sing.
10258|O'er the fields we go... +Laughing all the way...
10259|Even though I've heard that her taste in music is a little unusual...
10260|Bells on bob-tail ring...+Making spirits bright...
10261|I never knew that her singing is so beautiful.
10262|What fun it is to ride and sing +A sleighing song tonight.
10263|Suomi finishes her solo and all the T-Dolls join in on the Christmas song. +For some reason I feel like tearing up. +All I can do by the end of their performance is clap my hands off.
10264|Thank you so much. This is honestly the best Christmas Eve I've ever had...
10265|Before I could even finish expressing how moved I am, something unexpected happens.
10266|The Christmas Eve Party is about to begin. +Let's have some music to heat things up!
10267|Suomi! Wait-!
10268|By the time I notice where she is, it's already too late to stop her. +She has already fed a CD titled "METAL X'MAS" into the player.
10269|Deafening heavy-metal rock music overwhelms the entire banquet hall. +Most T-Dolls are covering their ears, but a few of them aren't fazed at all, and actually seem to appreciate it. +Meanwhile, those in charge of security are displaying commendable professionalism.
10270|I'll go handle the mixing console! +MG5, pick Suomi up and get her out of here!
10271|Sorry, Suomi!
10272|I found the switch!
10273|Under the cooperation of different T-Dolls, the playing track is promptly switched to more relaxing music.
10274|The banquet hall soon reverts back to the warm and cozy state of when I first entered. +...Except Suomi is sulking in the corner.
10275|Not going to eat, Suomi?
10276|...No. Not hungry.
10277|Looks like she's offended by having her track interrupted.
10278|What music were you playing just now?
10279|A song from my favorite band. +It's music that gives people strength... Why don't they like it?
10280|That's not true, Suomi. +The music you played was a bit...niche, but I did see several T-Dolls enjoying it quite a bit.
10281|Really... So some T-Dolls here do have decent tastes. +Do you like heavy metal, Commander?
10282|Uh... How should I put it... At least not all the time...
10283|Suomi bows her head dejectedly.
10284|I know that this kind of music is incomprehensible to many, +But it's one of the best things from my home country, so I still hope...that more people can appreciate it.
10285|Actually, it's quite interesting to try it every once in a while.
10286|Suomi looks up and stares intently at me. Then she digs out a CD from the pile of presents next to her.
10287|If you want a try, give this a go. +Beginner's level... Shouldn't be too hard to swallow.
10288|You're giving it to me?
10289|Yes.
10290|But you've already given me a Christmas present.
10291|That's from all of us. This one is only from me.
10292|Suomi withdraws her hands awkwardly.
10293|If you don't want it...I won't force it on you.
10294|Why would I not want it? +Every Christmas present is precious. I will try my best to enjoy it.
10295|I take the CD from Suomi. She looks decidedly more cheerful.
10296|Then give it a proper listen. +CDs like this are hard to find these days. It's the best memory of my homeland.
10297|Yes, I promise I will.
10298|Suomi finally smiles again and rejoins the festive merrymaking. +And thus I spent an unforgettable night with all of them.
10299|The Christmas Eve celebrations are about to start. A few impatient T-Dolls have already assembled at the square where the Christmas tree is. +According to the schedule, the first part of the event features Springfield giving out presents as Santa Claus. +Although it is tradition to put Christmas presents quietly by people's beds in the middle of the night, the instant gratification of receiving gifts means more to T-Dolls. +Of course, measures have to be taken to prevent them from messing around too much. +Just as I'm thinking about how to keep Santa safe, a metal bucket falls right in front of me.
10300|Whoa!
10301|Who's down there? +Oh, Commander?! Are you hurt?
10302|No, I'm fine... +But who's this...?
10303|It's me, NTW-20. +What, can't recognize me just because of this flimsy disguise, Commander?
10304|I pull myself together and finally realize it's NTW poking her head out. The two twig-like things on her head are meant to be deer antlers.
10305|Oh, it's NTW... What are you doing up there?
10306|Preparing for the event. +Want to come up, Commander? The ladder is at the back of this depot.
10307|Alright, I'll be right up.
10308|I climb up to the depot's roof and find NTW cleaning up scattered objects.
10309|Sorry about just now, Commander. +I didn't expect anyone to be around so I didn't pay attention...
10310|Haha, it's okay. +I should've been at my office waiting for the event to begin, but something came up and I had to head out... +What are you setting up here, NTW?
10311|I'll be sniping from here when the event begins. +But the roof is unexpectedly cluttered so I have to empty up some space to settle down.
10312|Oh...so you're Springfield's "partner"?
10313|Yeah.
10314|NTW points at her antlers.
10315|Springfield said according to human traditions, Santa Claus comes with reindeer or something, that's why I'm in this get-up. Is it weird?
10316|Haha, not really. +It's really festive, and it suits you.
10317|...It just feels a bit awkward for a hunter to dress up as prey. +But if you say so... I guess it's fine. +In any case, we'll have a delightful hunt today.
10318|I know how much you enjoy hunting, NTW...but don't go all out today. +The main objective is just to ensure Santa can deliver presents to everyone. +Even Santa will be sad if people don't get their presents.
10319|Don't worry, Commander. +I know full well what my prey is today. +I shall decimate the avarice of those who plot to sabotage the festivities and seize all the presents for themselves!
10320|Good. +That reminds me, is there any Christmas present that you want, NTW?
10321|Oh, even the reindeer gets a present?
10322|Of course. Everyone at the base deserves a gift at Christmas.
10323|NTW frowns and ponders for a while.
10324|I can't think of any present that I want.
10325|Then...what about a dream that you want to come true?
10326|A dream... I guess I want to see snow.
10327|See snow?
10328|Yeah, it never snows where I'm from. +I've trod through boundless deserts and prowled the deepest reaches of wild jungles, but I've never seen snow. +I hear the scenery is stunning when it snows. I really want to see it for myself...
10329|Yeah, a white Christmas is quite a sight to behold.
10330|But it's just a thought. +After all...the weather doesn't change to satisfy a hunter's caprice.
10331|Well, hard to say. +Christmas is a time when dreams come true.
10332|Come on, Commander. +I'm not a child... +But I'm very glad that you asked me about this.
10333|It's almost time, so I'll leave you to your work. +But...I suggest that you look forward to your Christmas present this year.
10334|I've already consulted the weather forecast while planning for the Christmas event. +It's a sunny day today, but I still have to add some final touches to make things more festive. +It's also for the sake of granting their wishes.
10335|After the commotion on the square died down, NTW didn't hurry to get indoors. +She sits on the rooftop and looks up at the starry sky.
10336|It's such a clear day... It can't possibly snow.
10337|NTW hops off the roof and makes her way toward the banquet hall. +A low buzz starts coming from the corner of the square. NTW pauses by the Christmas tree.
10338|...What's gong on? Have they left behind some sort of machinery outside?
10339|As NTW is searching for the source of the noise by the Christmas tree, a white snowflake lands lightly on her shoulder.
10340|Cold! ...It's...snow?
10341|She opens her palms to catch the snowflakes drifting down from the sky and dubiously watches as they slowly melt away.
10342|Christmas really is a time when dreams come true, isn't it?
10343|The snowmaking machines are working perfectly. +It took a lot of effort fixing them in the last two days, but just one look at NTW's expression makes it all worth it. +NTW turns and looks at me, a content smile on her face.
10344|Commander... +Now I truly believe in Santa Claus.
12576|+Humph. But M4A1 is the only one I'm after...+Perhaps it's about time you handed her over if you don't want me to execute you because I run out patience.
13156|So...we need to get off the ride now?
